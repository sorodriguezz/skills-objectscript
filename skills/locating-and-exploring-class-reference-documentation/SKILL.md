# Locating and Exploring Class Reference Documentation

Documentation

Local class reference documentation is always available on any system on which InterSystems IRIS® (or any product on which it is based) is installed. This class reference includes information on InterSystems classes as well as your own classes.

The URL has the following form, using the <baseURL> for your instance:

https://<baseURL>/csp/documatic/%25CSP.Documatic.cls

In the left menu, classes in the %SYS namespace are displayed by default. To change the namespace, select an option from the Namespace: drop-down list at the top left.
