# Data Serialization with the InterSystems Persister for Java

The InterSystems Persister for Java

See the Table of Contents for a detailed listing of the subjects covered in this document.

The InterSystems IRIS Persister for Java is a high speed data persistence engine, featuring a multi-threaded loader capable of ingesting and serializing nearly a million real time records per second. It uses a format based on Apache Avro [https://avro.apache.org/], a robust open source data serialization framework.

- Schema-based serialization format allows extremely fast, fle xible, reliable data persistence. Since the schema is always stored with the records, data can be exchanged with systems that have no prior knowledge of the data structure.

- Flexible, language agnostic design eases data exchange between systems, programming languages, and processing frameworks.

- Data is stored as serialized instances of ObjectScript classes. Sharded extents can be used, enabling shard factor buffering for parallel writes.

- Schemas can be generated from an existing ObjectScript class, created by inference from source data, or designed using the SchemaBuilder class.

The Persister is the successor to InterSystems XEP. Compared to XEP, the Persister is faster, much easier to implement, and far more powerful.

Overview of the Java Persister

The InterSystems IRIS® Persister for Java is designed to ingest data streams and persist them to a database at extremely high speed. Each thread-safe Persister instance consumes a data stream, serializes each record, and writes each serialized record to an output buffer or pool of buffers. Each buffer in a pool maintains a separate connection to an InterSystems IRIS server.

The Persister SDK uses a format based on the Apache Avro schema-based data serialization format, which enables extremely
fast, fle xible, reliable data persistence. The format consists of two parts:

- a schema, which describes the structure the data

- data records, serialized in a compact format without repetitive structural information Since the data and the schema are stored together, records can always be serialized or deserialized without any previous knowledge of their structure.

The Persister SDK provides several ways to create schemas. They can be generated from an existing ObjectScript class, created by inference from source data, or designed using the SchemaBuilder class.

When data is serialized to an InterSystems IRIS database, schemas are stored on the server in a Schema Registry, where they are available to any Persister application. Each schema in the registry defines a corresponding ObjectScript class, and records are stored as serialized instances of those classes.

The serialized classes are immediately usable through standard access methods, including ObjectScript and SQL. Indexes can be generated during serialization or deferred until later.

The Persister SDK has three main classes:

- Persister handles all aspects of reading, serializing, buffering, and writing data. Each instance of Persister is bound to one specific schema and its associated database e xtent. Persisters are thread-safe, and allow precise control and monitoring of buffers and buffer queues. See Serializing Data with Persister for details.

- SchemaManager implements schemas and makes them available to Persisters. It maintains a local cache of schemas for the current application, and synchronizes the cache with a persistent Schema Registry on the server. It provides Persisters with a connection to the database, and includes tools for creating and changing both schemas and their corresponding database extents. See Implementing Schemas with SchemaManager for details.

- SchemaBuilder is a utility that provides methods to construct schema definitions, which are returned as JSON strings. All construction methods are static and calls can be nested. Field types can be specified directly , or can be inferred from Java types, classes, or objects. See Designing Schemas with SchemaBuilder for details.

The following code fragments demonstrate the basic steps from schema creation to data serialization. The code uses the three main Persister SDK classes to create a schema, synchronize it to the server, and persist the serialized data (see Hello Persister in the Java Persister Examples section for a complete listing of the source application).

Overview of the Java Persister

Persister Workflow

The test data for this example consists of three String[] objects that are used to create a stream for the Persister to ingest.

String[][] data = new String[][]{{"Hello"},{"Bonjour"},{"Guten Tag"}};
Stream<Object[]> stream = Arrays.stream(data);

SchemaBuilder examines the first data record to infer the data structure, and returns the resulting schema as JSON string schemaJson. The schema name is Demo.Hello.

String[] fieldnames = new String[]{"greeting"}
String schemaJson = SchemaBuilder.infer(data[0],"Demo.Hello",fieldnames);

Next, a SchemaManager is created and connected to the InterSystems IRIS server (this example assumes that JDBC connection object irisConn already exists). The schema manager makes the JSON schema definition available to the application by synchronizing it to the Schema Registry on the server.

SchemaManager manager = new SchemaManager(irisConn);
RecordSchema schemaRec = manager.synchronizeSchema(schemaJson);

The synchronized schema is returned as schemaRec, a canonical RecordSchema object that identifies the e xtent of the associated ObjectScript class on the server. Synchronizing a schema creates a new extent if one does not already exist. The ObjectScript class has the same name as the schema, Demo.Hello.

Finally, a Persister object is created. It is bound to the Demo.Hello extent identified by schemaRec, and accesses the server through the connection provided by manager.

Persister persister = Persister.createPersister(manager, schemaRec,
Persister.INDEX_MODE_DEFERRED);

Each item in the data stream is passed to persister, which serializes the data and inserts each serialized record into the database extent.

persister.deleteExtent(); // delete old test data
stream.map(d -> new ArrayRecord(d, schemaRec)).forEach(persister::insert);

Once the data has been persisted, it can be retrieved by standard database access methods such as an SQL query.

Statement statement = irisConn.createStatement();
ResultSet rs = statement.executeQuery( "SELECT %ID, * FROM Demo.Hello");
while (rs.next()) {
System.out.printf( "\n Greeting: %s", rs.getString("greeting"));
}

The following sections discuss how the main Persister SDK classes are typically used:

- Serializing Data with Persister — describes how a Persister reads, serializes, buffers, and writes data.

- Implementing Schemas with SchemaManager — describes how a SchemaManager implements a schema on the server and makes it available to Persisters.

- Designing Schemas with SchemaBuilder — describes the structure of a schema and demonstrates how to create one with the SchemaBuilder utility.

See Java Persister Examples for complete program listings that are the source for many of the examples shown in other parts of this document.

Persister handles all aspects of reading, serializing, buffering, and writing data. Each instance of Persister is bound to one specific schema and its associated database e xtent. Persisters are thread-safe, and allow precise control and monitoring of buffers and buffer queues.

- A multi-threaded loader can be used to ingest large data sets. The loader consumes a data stream, serializing each record and writing each serialized record to a pool of output buffers.

- Each buffer maintains a separate connection to an InterSystems IRIS® server.

- If the targeted extent is a sharded extent then at least one buffer per shard factor is allocated, resulting in parallel writes to the factors.

- The size of the serialized object queues, the number of buffers allocated and the size of the buffers can be configured.

- The loader maintains its own connection pool which, in the case of sharded extents, may include connections to multiple servers.

Schemas define the content and structure of data messages and are used by serializers (data message producers) and deserializers (data message consumers).

Figure 3–1: Persister Architecture

The Persister can be used by Java applications to rapidly ingest large data sets into an InterSystems IRIS® server.

Data is organized as a set of records and is described by a Schema. Schemas are managed by the SchemaManager. The SchemaManager interacts with the InterSystems IRIS Schema Manager to synchronize schemas between the local schema cache and the Schema Repository on the server. A Persister instance is created by passing a SchemaManager instance and a RecordSchema (an implementation of the Record interface).

### 3.1 Persister Threading and Buffering

A Persister instance accepts data from the caller, serializes that data and writes it to a buffer. Buffers are automatically written to the InterSystems IRIS Server when full, on demand, and on close. Buffers to be written to the server can be either written immediately or placed in a queue that is monitored by a separate thread. The Persister constructor automatically creates an output buffer, but it is also possible to create local buffers for use in threads.

Thread-local instances of PersisterBuffer are created by calling Persister.createLocalBuffer().

- createLocalBuffer() creates an instance of PersisterBuffer for use exclusively within a thread. If a bufferQueue is specified, filled b

- uffers will be placed in the buffer queue instead of being written directly to the server PersisterBuffer createLocalBuffer () PersisterBuffer createLocalBuffer (LinkedBlockingQueue< BufferWrite > bufferQueue) flush() flushes a b uffer to the server or bufferQueue if there are objects in the buffer. Optional localBuffer specifies a local buffer to be flushed. This method can be used to finish a sequence of calls to add().

synchronized void flush () void flush (PersisterBuffer localBuffer)

#### 3.1.1 Using Local Buffers with PersisterBuffer

PersisterBuffer holds data that is intended to be written to a server using the provided connection. The buffer data is flushed whenever it is full, by direct call and when it is closed.

This class does not use any concurrency protections as it is primarily used by Persister, where protections are in place. The exception is for direct use by applications wishing to use a local buffer in a single thread. The local buffer can be flushed a buffer queue to be written to the database. The buffer queue is expected to be consumed by a separate thread running the BufferWriter runnable (see Threading with BufferWriter for details).

PersisterBuffer accumulates statistics, including number of objects written, total number of bytes written, and the number of buffer flushes (see Persister Buffer Statistics for details).

class PersisterBuffer

The following PersisterBuffer methods are available:

PersisterBuffer (long persisterFunction, int bufferSize, IRISConnection connection, ListWriter headerSuffix) PersisterBuffer (long persisterFunction, int bufferSize, IRISConnection connection, ListWriter headerSuffix, LinkedBlockingQueue bufferQueue)

final void add (ListWriter vList) final void addAndWrite (ListWriter vList) final void close () throws IOException final PersisterBuffer combine (PersisterBuffer otherBuffer) final long [] finish () void flush () static ListWriter getListWriter () static ListWriter getListWriter (byte[] byteArray) final long [] getStatistics () static void recycleListWriter (ListWriter idList) final void write ()

Persister Threading and Buffering

#### 3.1.2 Threading with BufferWriter

PersisterBuffer does not use any concurrency protections as it is primarily used by Persister where protections are in place. The exception is for direct use by applications wishing to use a local buffer in a single thread.

The buffer can be placed in a queue of buffers to be written. That queue is expected to be consumed by a separate thread running the BufferWriter runnable (BufferWriter.BufferWriterRun.run()).

BufferWriter

BufferWriter consumes a BlockingQueue of BufferWrite objects and writes each one to the server. The following
methods are available:

BufferWriter (BlockingQueue< BufferWrite > bufferQueue, IRISConnection connection) void close () throws IOException void stopBufferWriter () static BufferWriter startBufferWriter (BlockingQueue< BufferWrite > bufferQueue, IRISDataSource dataSource) static BufferWriter startBufferWriter (BlockingQueue< BufferWrite > bufferQueue, IRISConnection connection)

Using a buffer queue with BufferWriter

Persister instances are thread safe. To improve performance, it is possible to create buffers that are used in a single thread. The local buffers are not thread safe, so they are passed to a buffer queue rather than being written directly to the database. When the queue is full, BufferWriter writes the buffered data to the database.

Create bufferQueue to hold local buffers, then start bufferWriter.

LinkedBlockingQueue<BufferWrite> bufferQueue =
new LinkedBlockingQueue<BufferWrite>(200_000);
BufferWriter bufferWriter = BufferWriter.startBufferWriter(bufferQueue, dataSource);

Generate Runnable producer which provides a custom run() function to be passed to the threads. The runnable overrides function BufferWriter.BufferWriterRun.run().

Runnable producer = new Runnable() {
@Override
public void run() { // create separate local buffer for each thread
PersisterBuffer localBuffer = persister.createLocalBuffer(bufferQueue);
for (int i = 0; i < chunks; i++) { // get data from somewhere and insert it
Object[] data = new Object[3]{"Smith-Jones", true, 922285477L};
persister.insert(data, localBuffer);
}
persister.flush(localBuffer);
statistics.addThreadStat(persister.getStatistics(localBuffer));
}
};

Now call producer.run() from each thread and buffer the results:

Thread[] producerThreads = new Thread[producerThreadCount];
for (int tp = 0; tp < producerThreadCount; tp++) {
producerThreads[tp] = new Thread(producer); // pass producer.run() to thread
producerThreads[tp].start();
}
for (int tp = 0; tp < producerThreadCount; tp++) {
producerThreads[tp].join();
}
bufferWriter.stopBufferWriter();

See ThreadLoader in Java Persister Examples for a complete listing of the source program that provides this example.

### 3.2 Persister Buffer Statistics

Persister statistics are collected by the Persister and can be reported. Statistics are stored in a PersisterStatistics object
(described below). The following Persister statistics methods are available:

- getStatistics() — returns a PersisterStatistics object containing the current statistics from the buffer or a specified local buffer.

- reportStatistics() — displays a console message listing server write statistics since this Persister instance was created or reset (see details at end of this section).

- resetStatistics() — resets buffer startTime and refreshes baseStatistics. This will cause a future call to reportStatistics() to report on the activity starting from the time when this method is called. If localBuffer is specified, resets statistics for the local buffer.

These methods are typically called just before and after a set of Persister inserts. For example::

persister.resetStatistics();
PersisterStatistics statistics = new PersisterStatistics();
statistics.setStartTime((new Date(System.currentTimeMillis())).getTime())
;
//start BufferWriter / run Persister / stop BufferWriter

statistics.setStopTime((new Date(System.currentTimeMillis())).getTime());
statistics.reportStatistics();

class PersisterStatistics

This is a small class that tracks statistics for a specified b uffer: start time, stop time, number of objects, total bytes written, and number of buffers written to the server.

PersisterStatistics ()
PersisterStatistics (long startTime, long stopTime, long[] rawStat) PersisterStatistics (long startTime, long stopTime, ConcurrentLinkedQueue< long[]> rawStats)

synchronized void addThreadStat (PersisterStatistics persisterStatistics) long [] getCumulativeRaw () long getDuration () long getStartTime () long getStopTime () void reportStatistics () void setStartTime (long startTime) void setStopTime (long stopTime)

addThreadStat() — add a PersisterStatistics instance to this Persister instance, accumulating the statistics into the cumulativeStats and adding it to the threadStats List.

getCumulativeRaw() — return a long[] containing the accumulated statistics. The first element is the total object count, the second is the total byte count and the third is the total number of buffers used.

getDuration() — return the duration (stopTime - startTime) in milliseconds.

getStartTime() — start time in milliseconds.

getStopTime() — stop time in milliseconds.

reportStatistics() — display console message listing server write statistics since this Persister instance was created or reset.

setStartTime() — start time in milliseconds.

setStopTime() — stop time in milliseconds.

- Persister Buffer Statistics

- reportStatistics() writes the following statistics to the console:

- load() executed on [threadStats.size()] threads... Elapsed time (seconds) = [getDuration()/1000.0f] Number of objects stored = [objectCount] Store rate (obj/sec) = [objectCount * 1000.0/getDuration()] Total bytes written = [byteCount] Total buffers written = [bufferWrites] MB per second = [(byteCount / getDuration() * 1000f) / 1048576f]

- Avg object size = [byteCount / objectCount]

- Where:

- objectCount = getCumulativeRaw()[0] byteCount = getCumulativeRaw()[1] bufferWrites = getCumulativeRaw()[2]

- Implementing Schemas with
SchemaManager

- In order to persist date, the Persister requires a schema structure that is understood by both the Persister application and the server. The application must have a way to retrieve valid schemas from the server’s persistent Schema Registry, and to update existing schemas or add new ones. On the server side, the Schema Registry synchronization process must ensure that each schema has a corresponding ObjectScript class extent, creating a new extent if one does not already exist.

SchemaManager is the primary interface between a Persister application and the server. The SchemaManager provides each Persister instance with a validated schema and a connection to the server. The SchemaManager also communicates with the Schema Registry process, ensuring that application and server schema definitions are synchronized. To accomplish
this, the SchemaManager provides the following services to the Persister application:

- Synchronizes schema definitions with the Schema Registry, making a local cache of validated schemas available to the application.

- Provides the IRISConnection object that connects the Persister to the server.

- Adds new schema definitions to the Schema Re gistry (see Designing Schemas with SchemaBuilder)

- Retrieves existing schemas by name, and creates new ones from existing ObjectScript classes (see Acquiring Schemas from the Server)

- Includes schema and extent utilities that provide current information and allow schemas or extents to be deleted.

The following sections provide detailed information on synchronizing schemas, acquiring them from the server, and managing them with various utilities.

### 4.1 Synchronizing Schema Definitions

Each SchemaManager object maintains a local cache of schemas for the current application. In each InterSystems IRIS namespace, schema records are persisted in a Schema Registry, and are implemented in associated ObjectScript class
extents. A schema is said to be synchronized between the application and the server when:

- The named schema is present in the Schema Registry on the server.

- The Schema Registry record is implemented by an existing ObjectScript class extent.

- The SchemaManager object in the application has a schema in its local cache that matches the one in the Schema
Registry.

Implementing Schemas with SchemaManager

A schema is implemented by calling the synchronizeSchema() method, which passes it to the Schema Registry process on the server. If the server process is able to synchronize the schema, it is returned as canonical RecordSchema object, which is also stored in the SchemaManager’s local cache.

The synchronization process on the server can act in several different ways, depending on what information is already on
the server:

- If the requested schema does not exist in the Schema Registry, the process adds a new record to the Registry and creates a corresponding ObjectScript class extent.

- If a matching schema is already defined in the Schema Re gistry and is implemented by a matching ObjectScript extent, the process simply returns the currently defined RecordSchema.

- If a schema of the same name is in the Registry, but does not match the parameter passed by synchronizeSchema(), the differences are resolved. The resolution may require generating a new version of the local implementation class. In this case, the new class will be kept compatible with existing data.

If the schema does not exist in the Registry but an ObjectScript class with the same name exists, then a schema is generated from that ObjectScript class and synchronized.

Once the schema is synchronized, a Persister can be used to store data in the extent of the implementing ObjectScript class (see Serializing Data with Persister).

### 4.2 Acquiring Schemas from the Server

SchemaManager has two methods to acquire schemas from existing server information:

- getSchema() gets and synchronizes an existing schema from the Schema Registry.

- getSchemaForClass() creates and synchronizes a schema from an existing ObjectScript class.

getSchema()

Given a schema name, getSchema() will first check to see if the requested schema is already in the local cache. If not, it checks the Schema Registry on the server. If the schema is present there then it is retrieved, placed in the local cache and returned to the caller.

Schema demoSchema = mgr.getSchema("Demo.Hello");
System.out.println(demoSchema.toJson());

The resulting schema may contain some metadata added by the Schema Registry.

{"name":"Hello","namespace":"Demo","final":false,"importFlags":0, "category":"persistent",

"type": "record", "fields": [{"name":"greeting", "type":"string"}]}

getSchemaForClass()

getSchemaForClass() — A schema can also be generated from an existing ObjectScript class. If the schema for that class already exists and is up to date then the previously defined schema is retrie ved. Otherwise, a new schema is generated from the class and returned to the caller.

RecordSchema someSchema = schemaManager.getSchemaForClass("Demo.someClass");

Schema and Extent Utilities

### 4.3 Schema and Extent Utilities

The following examples assume that there is a schema with namespace Test.Demo and name Hello. By default the corresponding ObjectScript class will have a package name and short name identical to the schema namespace and name. The corresponding SQL table name would be Test_Demo.Hello (see Designing Schemas with SchemaBuilder for more information on schema names).

Schema Utilities

All of these SchemaManager methods act only on schemas stored in the Schema Registry on the server. They do not affect or require a schema with the same name on the application side.

- deleteIrisSchema() — deletes the schema definition from the Schema Re gistry on the server. Also deletes the corresponding ObjectScript class (if it exists), and all data in the class extent.

- manager.deleteIrisSchema("Test.Demo.Hello");

- isIrisSchemaDefined() — returns true if a schema with the specified name is defined in the Schema Re gistry.

boolean isDefined = manager.isIrisSchemaDefined("Test.Demo.Hello");

isSchemaUpToDate() — returns true if the structure of the specified ObjectScript class matches the corresponding schema in the Schema Registry.

boolean isCurrent = manager.isSchemaUpToDate("Test.Demo.Hello");

Extent Utilities

- deleteIrisExtent() — given a schema name, deletes the extent of the associated ObjectScript class.

- manager.deleteIrisExtent("Test.Demo.Hello"); isIrisClassDefined() — returns true if the ObjectScript class is defined on the serv er. The class does not have to match an entry in the Schema Registry.

boolean isDefined = manager.isIrisClassDefined("Test.Demo.Hello");

- getIrisTableClass() — gets the name of the ObjectScript class that projects the specified SQL table.

String tableClass = manager.getIrisTableClass("Test_Demo.Hello");

In this example, a query on table name Test_Demo.Hello would return class name Test.Demo.Hello, where Test.Demo is the class package name and Hello is the unqualified class name.

Designing Schemas with SchemaBuilder

SchemaBuilder is a utility that provides simple calls to construct schema definitions, which are returned as JSON strings. All construction methods are static and calls can be nested. Field types can be specified directly or inferred from Ja va types, classes, or objects.

There are several ways to create schemas. One of the easiest is to use SchemaBuilder.infer() to construct a schema from
sample data and corresponding field names. F or example:

Object[] values = new Object[]{"Apple", 2};
String[] labels = new String[]{"item","count"};
String schemaFruit = SchemaBuilder.infer(values,"Demo.Fruit",labels);

Schemas can also be designed using SchemaBuilder.record(), which provides builder methods such as addfield() to create schema components. Builder methods can be chained until complete() is called to return the JSON schema string.

The following call to record() produces a JSON schema string identical to the one produced by infer():

String schemaFruit = SchemaBuilder.record()
.withName("Test.Demo.Fruit")
.addField("item", "string") .addField("count", "int")
.complete();

Both of the examples above will return the same JSON schema string (line breaks added for clarity):

{"type":"record",
"namespace":"Test.Demo",
"name":"Fruit", "category":"persistent", "fields":[
{"name":"item","type":"string"},
{"name":"count","type":"int"}
]}

This schema contains the following components:

- type — Schemas can have various types (in the example above, notice that each field is a schema with its o wn type), but Persister schemas will always be stored in the server Schema Registry as record types (class RecordSchema).

- namespace — A schema name qualifier . It is important to note that schema namespaces have nothing to do with InterSystems IRIS database namespaces. Schema namespaces are part of the qualified schema name, which also determines the fully qualified name of the corresponding ObjectScript class. F or example, the Test.Demo.Fruit schema has namespace Test.Demo and name Fruit. The corresponding class would be Test.Demo.Fruit (package name Test.Demo and short class name Fruit). This class could be stored in any InterSystems IRIS namespace (for example, the USER namespace).

- name — The unqualified schema name. This is the final part of the identifier you specify for the schema. F or example, if you specify .withname(Test.Demo.Fruit), the namespace will be Test.Demo, and the name will be Fruit.

Designing Schemas with SchemaBuilder

The corresponding SQL table will be named Test_Demo.Fruit (see Table Names and Schema Names in Using InterSystems SQL for related information on naming conventions).

- category — Since InterSystems IRIS stores records as serialized instances of ObjectScript classes, Persister schemas need to differentiate between classes that extend %Library.Persistent and those that extend %Library.SerialObject (embedded objects). The default is Persistent if no value is specified.

- fields — Each field entry is specified as a schema with its o wn name and type. The Persister supports primitive types string, bytes, short, int, long, float, double, boolean, and null. Comple x type declarations can include their own fields, nested as deep as necessary .

SchemaBuilder.record() provides an extra level of control when specifying field types. F or example, a schema for the fol-
lowing object could be created by either infer() or record():

Object[] data = new Object[];
data[0] = "Wilber";
data[1] = true;
data[2] = new Object[][] {{0,1},{2,3}};
data[3] = java.util.UUID.randomUUID();
data[4] = new java.util.Date();

It is very simple to create the schema by inference from data:

String[] names = {"Name","isActive","Scores","MemberID","DateJoined"};
String schemaJson = SchemaBuilder.infer(data,"Demo.ClubMember",names);

But the record() builder methods allow individual field types to be specified in se veral different ways. Types can still be inferred from data, but they can also be inferred from Java class names or specified directly as Ja va types. Some complex types such as dates and times can be also be specified using logical type methods. The following example demonstrates all
of these options:

String schemaJson = SchemaBuilder.record()
.withName("Demo.ClubMember")
.addField("Name", SchemaBuilder.infer("java.lang.String")) .addField("isActive", SchemaBuilder.infer(true)) .addField("Scores", java.lang.Integer[].class) .addField("MemberID", SchemaBuilder.uuid()) .addField("DateJoined", SchemaBuilder.date())
.complete();

In the first tw o fields, Name and isActive, types are determined by calling infer() on class name "java.lang.String" and value true. The Scores field directly specifies class type java.lang.Integer[].class. The last two fields use
logical type methods uuid() and date(). This produces the following JSON schema string:

{"type":"record",
"name":"ClubMember", "namespace":"Demo", "category":"persistent", "fields":[
{"name":"Name", "type":"string"},
{"name":"isActive", "type":"boolean"},
{"name":"Scores", "type":{"type":"array", "items":"int"}}
{"name":"MemberID", "type":{"logicalType":"uuid", "type":"string"}},
{"name":"DateJoined", "type":{"logicalType":"date", "type":"int"}},
]}

This schema is almost identical to one produced by simple inference, except for the last field. The date() method produces a logical type for java.util.Date, while inference would produce a logical type for java.sql.Timestamp.

This section provides full listing for several working Persister programs:

- Hello Persister — a quick demonstration of the basic Persister workflo w.

- Continents - load data from a local array

- DivvyTrip - Chicago Bicycle Sharing CSV file (small - 1.5 million records)

- ThreadLoader — load a large data set- 20 million records

Note:

The Persister, like all InterSystems Java drivers, connects to the database with a standard InterSystems JDBC IRISConnection object (see Using IRISDataSource to Connect in Using Java with InterSystems Software). IRISDataSource is the recommended way to create a the connection because a DataSource is required to use the Persister’s multi-threaded loader.

### 6.1 Hello Persister

This very short Persister application demonstrates all of the basic Persister mechanisms from schema creation to data serialization, using the three main Persister classes: SchemaBuilder creates a schema, SchemaManager synchronizes the schema to the Schema Registry on the server, and Persister serializes and stores records in the extent specified by the Re gistry.

### 6.3 DivvyTrip - CSV bicycle sharing dataset (small - 1.5 million records)

The City of Chicago’s Divvy bicycle sharing data sets are publicly available. This example shows how a local file containing data in CSV format can be loaded using streams and Persister. The schema used here is generated from an existing Inter- Systems IRIS class (RowDB.DivvyTrip) created by a series of DDL statements (see listing in TABLE DivvyTrip). The data set used in this example concatenates several months of Divvy data. To simplify the example, the data was preprocessed to eliminate rows that contain null entries.

Quick Reference for Java Persister
Classes

This section is a reference for the InterSystems Persister for Java SDK (namespace com.intersystems.persister). This quick
reference covers the following SDK classes:

- class Persister — main interface for serializing records to the database.

- class SchemaManager — main interface for coordinating schemas between Persister applications and the server.

- class SchemaBuilder — utility for creating schema definitions.

Note:

This quick reference is intended as a convenient guide to the Java Persister classes and methods discussed in this document. It does not cover all public classes, and is not a complete or definiti ve reference for the Java Persister. For the most complete and up-to-date information, see the Java Persister online documentation. In many cases, documentation and examples from Avro implementations may also be helpful.

### 7.1 Class Persister

The com.intersystems.persister.Persister class defines and implements the main interf ace for the InterSystems IRIS Persister for Java SDK. Persister is used to write data to the extent of a persistent class. See Serializing Data with Persister for more information and examples.

#### 7.1.1 Persister Constructor

Constructor

Persister.Persister() is used to write data to the extent of an ObjectScript persistent class. A SchemaManager provides the connection to the target extent and interfaces with the Schema Registry on the server.

Persister (SchemaManager schemaManager, RecordSchema schema, int indexMode) throws
PersisterException
Persister (SchemaManager schemaManager, RecordSchema schema, int indexMode, int bufferSize) throws PersisterException

parameter:

- schemaManager — a local instance of SchemaManager connected to the Schema Registry on the server.

- schema — a schema (either a JSON string or a RecordSchema) describing the target extent on the server.

- indexMode — valid values are attributes INDEX_MODE_DEFAULT (= -1), INDEX_MODE_DEFERRED (= 0), or INDEX_MODE_IMMEDIATE (= 2).

- bufferSize — optional buffer size. Defaults to attribute DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE (= 32_000)

#### 7.1.2 Persister Methods

add()

Persister.add() adds one or more records to a buffer. If adding a record causes the buffer to overflo w then the buffer automatically flushes to the serv er. Persister.flush() may be used to write a partially filled b

uffer.

Local buffers are presumed to be thread-private as there are no concurrency guarantees with local buffers.

add ( record )

serializes and adds one or more Record objects to the buffer.

synchronized void add (Record record) synchronized< R extends Record > void add (R[] records)

record — the Record object to be added to the buffer

records — array of Record objects to be added to the buffer

- add ( list )

- adds one or more serialized ListWriter records to the buffer.

synchronized void add (ListWriter vList) synchronized void add (ListWriter[] lists)

- vList — serialized ListWriter object to be added to the buffer

- lists — array of ListWriter objects to be added to the buffer add ( list, localBuffer ) adds one or more serialized ListWriter records to the specified local b uffer.

void add (ListWriter serial, PersisterBuffer localBuffer) synchronized void add (ListWriter[] lists, PersisterBuffer localBuffer)

- serial — serialized ListWriter object

- lists — array of serialized ListWriter objects

- localBuffer — local buffer where serialized value is to be added close() Persister.close() close this instance of Persister.

void close ()

createLocalBuffer()

Persister.createLocalBuffer() creates an instance of PersisterBuffer that is expected to be used within a thread and not shared with any other threads as there are no built in concurrency controls. If bufferQueue is specified, filled b uffers will be placed in the buffer queue instead of being written directly to the server.

PersisterBuffer createLocalBuffer () PersisterBuffer createLocalBuffer (LinkedBlockingQueue< BufferWrite > bufferQueue)

parameter:

- bufferQueue — optional queue where filled b uffers will be placed.

createPersister()

Persister.createPersister() constructs and returns an instance of Persister that is bound to the specified Schema. Works exactly like the Constructor.

static Persister createPersister (SchemaManager schemaManager, RecordSchema schema, int indexMode) static Persister createPersister (SchemaManager schemaManager, RecordSchema schema, int indexMode, int bufferSize)

parameter:

schemaManager — a local instance of SchemaManager connected to the Schema Registry on the server.

schema — a schema (either a JSON string or a RecordSchema) describing the target extent on the server.

indexMode — valid values are attributes INDEX_MODE_DEFAULT (= -1), INDEX_MODE_DEFERRED (= 0), or INDEX_MODE_IMMEDIATE (= 2).

bufferSize — optional buffer size. Defaults to attribute DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE (= 32_000)

- delete()

- Persister.delete() deletes a single object from the extent of the server class bound to this persister.

- void delete (Long id) void delete (String id)

- parameter:

- id — id of the object to delete. In the case where the IDKEY is a composite key, the id is a delimited string serialization of the IDKEY key properties using || as a delimiter.

deleteExtent()

Persister.deleteExtent() deletes all of the data from the extent of the server class that is bound to this persister.

void deleteExtent ()

flush()

Persister.flush() flushes a b uffer to the server or bufferQueue (see createLocalBuffer()) if there are objects in the buffer. localBuffer optionally specifies a local b uffer to be flushed. This method can be used to finish a sequence of calls to add().

synchronized void flush () void flush (PersisterBuffer localBuffer)

parameter:

- localBuffer — local PersisterBuffer to be flushed getStatistics() Persister.getStatistics() returns a PersisterStatistics object containing the current statistics from the buffer or a specified

localBuffer (see Persister Buffer Statistics for details).

PersisterStatistics getStatistics () PersisterStatistics getStatistics (PersisterBuffer localBuffer)

parameter:

- localBuffer — local buffer where statistics are recorded.

insert()

Persister.insert() immediately writes records into the extent of the class that implements this persister's schema (unlike add(), which writes to a buffer that may not be flushed immediately).

insert( object )

inserts one or more objects into the extent of the class that implements this persister's schema. Each object contains an array of schema field v alues (where element 0 of the array is the first field in the schema). If localBuffer is specified, the data array is written to the local buffer, which is then immediately flushed to the server.

synchronized void insert (Object[] object) synchronized void insert (Object[][] data) void insert (Object[][] data, PersisterBuffer localBuffer)

parameter:

- object — an array of field v alues.

- data — an array of field v alue arrays.

- localBuffer — optional local buffer insert( record ) inserts one or more new Record objects into the extent of the class that implements this persister's schema.

synchronized void insert (Record record) synchronized void insert (Record[] data)

parameter:

- record — an object implementing the Record interface.

- data — an array of Record objects.

insert( map )

inserts one or more new Map objects into the extent of the class that implements this persister's schema. Each object contains a map of schema field v alues (for example JsonRecord or MapRecord values).

synchronized void insert (Map< String, Object > map) synchronized void insert (Map< String, Object >[] data)

parameter:

- map — Map where key is the field name and v alue is the field v alue.

- data — an array of field v alue maps.

insert( stream )

inserts all data in a stream into the extent of the class that implements this persister's schema. The factory function maps the data from the stream to a Record. The buffer is automatically flushed either when it becomes full or when the stream is completely consumed.

synchronized< R extends Record, T extends Object > void insert (BiFunction< T, RecordSchema, R > factory, Stream< T > data)

parameter:

- factory — the Record factory function used to instantiate the records to which data is mapped.

–

–

<R> — optional Record implementation class. This can often be inferred from the factory function.

<T> — optional data type. This can often be inferred from the Stream.

- data — the data Stream.

reportStatistics()

Persister.reportStatistics() writes report to the console. Reports the server write statistics for activity since this persister was constructed. If localBuffer is specified, reports serv er write statistics for the local buffer (see Persister Buffer Statistics for more information).

void reportStatistics () void reportStatistics (PersisterBuffer localBuffer)

parameter:

- localBuffer — local buffer containing statistics to be reported resetStatistics() Persister.resetStatistics() resets buffer startTime and refreshs baseStatistics. This will cause a future call to reportStatistics() to report on the activity starting from the time when this method is called. If localBuffer is specified, resets statistics for the local b uffer.

synchronized void resetStatistics () void resetStatistics (PersisterBuffer localBuffer)

parameter:

- localBuffer — local buffer containing statistics to be reset.

serialize()

Persister.serialize() serializes an Object[], Map, or Record and returns the serialization.

ListWriter serialize (Object[] value) ListWriter serialize (Map< String, Object > value) ListWriter serialize ( Record value )

parameter:

- value — value to be serialized.

waitForIndexing()

Persister.waitForIndexing() builds deferred indexes for the specified class on the serv er and waits for completion. Returns true if indexing has completed, false if timed out before index build is completed.

final boolean waitForIndexing ()

### 7.2 class SchemaManager

Class com.intersystems.persister.SchemaManager is connected to an InterSystems server. Each server maintains a Schema
Registry in each namespace. The SchemaManager maintains a cache of schemas that are synchronized with the Schema Registry and available to the application. Once a specified schema is synchronized with the serv er, a Persister can be used to store data in the extent of the ObjectScript class that implements that schema. See Implementing Schemas with SchemaManager for more information and examples.

#### 7.2.1 SchemaManager Constructor

Constructor

Persister.SchemaManager() accepts an IRISConnection object and returns a SchemaManager.

SchemaManager (IRISConnection connection) throws SQLException

parameter:

- connection — a connected IRISConnection object (standard InterSystems JDBC connection object).

#### 7.2.2 SchemaManager Methods

deleteIrisExtent()

SchemaManager.deleteIrisExtent() deletes the persistent extent in the current namespace for the server’s local ObjectScript implementation class. Throws an exception if the schema does not exist or if there is an error encountered during delete. Also see Persister.delete(), which can delete a single object from the extent.

void deleteIrisExtent (String schema_name)

parameter:

- schema_name — string specifying a schema name.

deleteIrisSchema()

SchemaManager.deleteIrisSchema() deletes the schema definition from the serv er. If the associated ObjectsScript implementation class exists, it will also be deleted, along with any data in its extent. Throws an exception if any errors are encountered.

void deleteIrisSchema (String schemaName)

parameter:

- schemaName — string specifying a schema name.

getIrisTableClass()

SchemaManager.getIrisTableClass() gets the name of the class that projects the tableName table.

class SchemaManager

String getIrisTableClass (String tableName)

parameter:

- tableName — string specifying a table name.

getSchema()

SchemaManager.getSchema() gets a schema from the local Schema Registry. If it is a NamedSchema then get it from the local cache or from the server if not present in the cache. Returns an instance of a class that implements
Schema.

Schema getSchema (String name) throws JsonProcessingException

parameter:

- name — string specifying the schema name.

getSchemaForClass()

SchemaManager.getSchemaForClass() retrieves the schema from the connected server whose local ObjectScript implementation class is class_name If the schema for the class already exists and is up to date then that schema is retrieved. Otherwise, a new schema is generated from the class and returned.

RecordSchema getSchemaForClass (String className) throws JsonProcessingException

parameter:

- className — name of the ObjectScript class that implements the current schema.

isIrisClassDefined()

SchemaManager.isIrisClassDefined() return true if the ObjectScript class is defined on the serv er.

boolean isIrisClassDefined (String name)

parameter:

- name — name of the ObjectScript class.

isIrisSchemaDefined()

SchemaManager.isIrisSchemaDefined() return true if the schema is defined in the Schema Re gistry

boolean isIrisSchemaDefined (String name)

parameter:

- name — string specifying the schema name.

isSchemaUpToDate()

SchemaManager.isSchemaUpToDate() returns true if the schema matches ObjectScript implementation class class_name on the server.

boolean isSchemaUpToDate (String class_name)

parameter:

- class_name — name of the ObjectScript class.

parseSchema()

SchemaManager.parseSchema() parses the schema source, returning an instance of a class that implements
Schema.

Schema parseSchema (String source) throws JsonProcessingException Schema parseSchema (JsonNode source) throws JsonProcessingException

parameter:

- source — source of the schema; either a String or a JsonNode (an instance of
com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonNode)

synchronizeSchema()

SchemaManager.synchronizeSchema() synchronizes a schema (either a JSON string or a RecordSchema) with the connected Schema Registry and returns the synchronized schema as a RecordSchema. If the schema is already defined in the Schema Re gistry then it is returned. If an ObjectScript class whose name matches the name defined by schemaSource exists then a schema is generated from that ObjectScript class and returned. Otherwise, schemaSource is added to the Schema Registry and an ObjectScript implementation class is generated. The resulting schema from the server is then returned.

When there is a matching schema already defined in the Schema Re gistry, it is compared with the schemaSource. If there is a difference then those differences are resolved, possibly generating a new version of the local implementation class. Existing data is kept compatible with the new class.

RecordSchema synchronizeSchema (String schemaSource) throws PersisterException,
JsonProcessingException
RecordSchema synchronizeSchema (RecordSchema schema) throws PersisterException RecordSchema synchronizeSchema (String schemaSource, String annotations) RecordSchema synchronizeSchema (RecordSchema schema, String annotations) throws
PersisterException

parameter:

- schemaSource — JSON formatted schema definition

- schema — a RecordSchema formatted schema definition

- annotations — JSON formatted object with indices field (see SchemaBuilder.index() and indexes()).

Throws PersisterException if the server reports a problem. JsonProcessingException is thrown by the Jackson JSON parser.

synchronizeSchemaWithIris()

SchemaManager.synchronizeSchemaWithIris() allows the manager to establish a new connection and synchronize using that connection. Once connected, it synchronizes a schema definition with the connected serv er and returns the corresponding RecordSchema retrieved from the Schema Registry at that location. If annotations is specified, the index definitions contained in the annotation are also applied. If the named schema already e xists on the server

then it is simply returned. If it does not exist but a class of the same name does exist then a schema is generated on the server and returned. Otherwise, the schema is saved to the server, compiled, and the resulting schema is then returned. The new connection is closed when this method returns.

static RecordSchema synchronizeSchemaWithIris (RecordSchema schema, IRISConnection connection) throws SQLException static RecordSchema synchronizeSchemaWithIris (RecordSchema schema, IRISConnection connection, String annotations) throws SQLException

parameter:

- schema — RecordSchema sent to the server

- connection — IRISConnection object connected to the server

- annotations — JSON formatted object containing index definitions Throws SQLException if there is an issue obtaining a connection to the server.

static String normalizeAsJson (String value)

parameter:

- value — String value to be normalized.

primitive()

SchemaBuilder.primitive() builds a primitive schema and returns string containing a JSON formatted schema.

static String primitive (String type)

parameter:

- type — String specifying primitive schema type. Valid values are string, bytes, short, int, long, float, double, boolean, or null.

record()

SchemaBuilder.record() returns an instance of subclass RecordSchemaBuilder, which can be used to create a JSON schema string.

static RecordSchemaBuilder record ()

SchemaBuilder.RecordSchemaBuilder

RecordSchemaBuilder has the following methods, all of which can be chained. The final call in the chain
must be the complete() method, which returns the finished record schema definition as a JSON string:

RecordSchemaBuilder addField (String name) RecordSchemaBuilder addField (String name, String type) RecordSchemaBuilder addField (String name, Schema type) RecordSchemaBuilder addField (String name, Class type) RecordSchemaBuilder addField (String name, Type type) RecordSchemaBuilder addField (RecordField field) RecordSchemaBuilder asEmbedded () RecordSchemaBuilder asFinal () RecordSchemaBuilder category (String category) String complete () RecordSchemaBuilder extendsClasses (String superClasses) RecordSchemaBuilder extendsSchema (RecordSchema superSchema) RecordSchemaBuilder withFinal (boolean isFinal) RecordSchemaBuilder withName (String name) RecordSchemaBuilder withName (SchemaName name)

reference()

SchemaBuilder.reference() returns a LogicalSchema of type intersystems-reference as a JSON formatted string

static String reference (String referencedSchema)

parameter:

- referencedSchema — the schema that is referenced timeMicros() SchemaBuilder.timeMicros() returns a LogicalSchema of type time-micros as a JSON formatted string (see LogicalSchema Types).

static String timeMicros ()

timeMillis()

SchemaBuilder.timeMillis() returns a LogicalSchema of type time-millis as a JSON formatted string (see LogicalSchema Types).

static String timeMillis ()

timestampIrisPosix()

SchemaBuilder.timestampIrisPosix() returns a LogicalSchema of type IRIS POSIX timestamp as a JSON formatted string (see LogicalSchema Types).

static String timestampIrisPosix ()

timeStampMicros()

SchemaBuilder.timeStampMicros() returns a LogicalSchema of type timestamp-micros as a JSON formatted string

static String timeStampMicros ()

timeStampMillis()

SchemaBuilder.timeStampMillis() returns a LogicalSchema of type timestamp-millis as a JSON formatted string

static String timeStampMillis ()

uuid()

SchemaBuilder.uuid() returns a LogicalSchema of type UUID as a JSON formatted string (see LogicalSchema
Types).

static String uuid ()

#### 7.3.2 SchemaBuilder LogicalSchema Methods

SchemaBuilder supports the following logical type methods, which currently return the JSON schema strings shown here:

- date() — (returns logical java.util.Date) {"logicalType":"date","type":"int"}

- decimal() — {"logicalType":"decimal","type":"bytes","precision":<int>,"scale":<int>}

- embedded() — {"logicalType":"intersystems-embedded","type":"string","value":{<embedded
schema string>}}

- reference() — {"logicalType": "intersystems-reference", "type": "string", "value",
<referencedSchema>}

- timeMicros() — {"logicalType": "time-micros", "type": "int"}

- timeMillis() — {"logicalType": "time-millis", "type": "int"}

- timestampIrisPosix() — {"logicalType": LogicalSchema.LOGICAL_TYPE_TIMESTAMP_IRIS_POSIX,
"type": "long"}

- timeStampMicros() — {"logicalType": "timestamp-micros", "type": "long"}

- timeStampMillis() — {"logicalType": "timestamp-millis", "type": "long"}

- uuid() — {"logicalType": LogicalSchema.LOGICAL_TYPE_UUID, "type": "string"}
