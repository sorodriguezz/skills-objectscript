# Class Definition Syntax and Keyword Reference

and Keywords

This reference formally describes the syntax and keywords used in class definitions. See the Table of Contents for a complete list of structures and keywords that apply to specific class members.

Class definitions are not formally part of ObjectScript. Rather, you can use ObjectScript within specific parts of class defi-
nitions (particularly within method definitions, where you can also use other implementation languages).

This page briefly surv eys the class definition structures that are discussed in this reference.

### 1.1 Class Definitions

A class definition defines a class. A class definition consists of class members (such as properties and methods) and other items, called keywords, each with associated values, that specify details of the class behavior. In InterSystems IRIS, a class can also include items not usually defined in classes, including triggers, queries, and inde xes.

The language used to define the v arious class members (not including any ObjectScript, Python, SQL or other code used to implement the members) is sometimes referred to as the Class Definition Language (CDL).

See Class Definition Syntax and K eywords in this reference.

- 1.2 Foreign Key Definitions A foreign key defines a referential inte grity constraint. When a table containing a foreign key constraint is modified, the foreign key constraints are checked. You can add foreign key definitions to persistent classes. They are not meaningful in other kinds of classes. You can also enforce reference integrity by defining relationship properties that connect the classes.

See Foreign Key Syntax and Keywords in this reference.

- 1.3 Index Definitions An index is a structure maintained by a persistent class that is intended to be used to optimize queries and other functions. These indexes are automatically maintained whenever INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE SQL-based operations are carried
out against the database; likewise for object-based actions. The SQL Query Processor makes use of available indexes when
preparing and executing SQL queries. You can add index definitions to persistent classes. They are not meaningful in other kinds of classes.

See Index Syntax and Keywords in this reference.

### 1.4 Method Definitions

InterSystems IRIS supports two types of methods: instance methods and class methods. An instance method is invoked
from a specific instance of a class and performs some action related to that instance; this type of method is useful only in
object classes. A class method is a method that can be invoked whether or not an instance of its class is in memory; this
type of method is called a static method in other languages.

See Method Syntax and Keywords in this reference.

See also:

- 1.5 Parameter Definitions

- A parameter definition defines a constant v (or at any point before compilation), you can set the values for its class parameters. By default, the value of each parameter alue available to all objects of a given class. When you create a class definition is the null string, but you can specify a non-null value as part of the parameter definition. At compile-time, the value of the parameter is established for all instances of a class. With rare exceptions, this value cannot be altered at runtime.

Projection Definitions

See Parameter Syntax and Keywords in this reference.

- Defining and Referring to Class P arameters

### 1.6 Projection Definitions

A class projection provides a way to extend the behavior of the class compiler. The projection mechanism is used by the
Java projections; hence the origin of the term projection.

A projection definition instructs the class compiler to perform specified operations when a class definition is compiled or removed. A projection defines the name of a projection class (deri ved from the %Projection.AbstractProjection class) that implements methods that are called when the compilation of a class is complete and when a class definition is remo ved (either because it is being deleted or because the class is about to be recompiled).

See Projection Syntax and Keywords in this reference.

See also:

- 1.7 Property Definitions A property contains information relevant to an instance of a class. You can add property definitions to object classes. They are not meaningful in other kinds of classes.

See Property Syntax and Keywords in this reference.

See also:

- 1.8 Query Definitions

- A class query defines an SQL query that can be used by the class and specifies a class to use as a container for the query . Often (but not necessarily), you define class queries in a persistent class, to perform queries on the stored data for that class. You can, however, define class queries in an y class.

- See Query Syntax and Keywords in this reference.

Introduction to Class Definition Syntax and Keywords

- 1.9 Trigger Definitions Triggers are code segments executed when specific e vents occur in InterSystems SQL. InterSystems IRIS supports triggers based on the execution of INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE commands. The specified code will be e xecuted either immediately before or immediately after the relevant command is executed, depending on the trigger definition. Each e vent can have multiple triggers as long as they are assigned an execution order. You can add trigger definitions to persistent classes. They are not meaningful in other kinds of classes.

See Trigger Syntax and Keywords in this reference.

See also:

- 1.10 XData Blocks

- An XData block is a named unit of data defined within the class, typically for use by a method in the class. These have many possible applications.

See XData Block Syntax and Keywords in this reference.

See also:

- 1.11 Storage Definitions The %Persistent class provides the high-level interface for storing and retrieving objects in the database. The actual work of storing and loading objects is performed by a storage class. The class is specified by a storage definition, which contains a set of keywords, values, and additional parameters used by the storage interface.

See Storage Keywords in this reference.

Top Level Class Syntax

Describes the structure of a class definition. See Class Definitions for links to general information on defining classes.

Introduction
In InterSystems IRIS, a class can include familiar class elements such as properties, methods, and parameters (known as constants in other class languages). It can also include items not usually defined in classes, including triggers, queries, and indexes.

A class definition defines a class. A class definition consists of class members (such as properties and methods) and other items, called keywords, each with associated values, that specify details of the class behavior.

Details
A class definition has the follo wing structure:

Import import_ppackage_list Include include_code IncludeGenerator include_generator_code

/// description
Class package.shortclassname Extends superclass_list [ class_keyword_list ]
{
Class_members
[Parameter]
[Property]
[Method]
[Foreign Key]
[Index]
[Projection]
[Query]
[Storage]
[Trigger]
[XData Block]
}

Where:

- import_package_list (optional) specifies the names of an y packages that you wish your class to import from. This
affects how the compiler resolves short class names; see Importing Packages.

This option, if specified, is either the name of a single package or is a comma-separated list of multiple packages, enclosed in parentheses.

If import_package_list is null, do not add the Import line at the start of the class definition.

Note:

If a class imports any packages, that class does not automatically import the User package.

Imported packages are inherited from all superclasses. If a subclass specifies one or more import packages, those are added to any import packages defined by the superclasses.

- include_code (optional) specifies InterSystems IRIS include ( .inc) files used when compiling this class.

This option, if specified, is either the name of a single include file (without the list of multiple include files, enclosed in parentheses.

.inc extension) or is a comma-separated

If include_code is null, omit the Include line at the start of the class definition.

For an introduction to include files, see Macros and Include Files.

Include files are inherited from all superclasses. If a subclass specifies one or more include files, those are added to any include files defined by the superclasses.

include_generator_code (optional) specifies InterSystems IRIS include ( .inc) files used when compiling the generator methods for this class. For information on generator methods, see Defining Method and Trigger Generators.

- Top Level Class Syntax For general comments, see the previous item.

If include_generator_code is null, do not add the IncludeGenerator line at the start of the class definition.

description (optional) is intended for display in the Class Reference. A description may consist of multiple lines and may include HTML formatting tags and additional tags such as <class> and <method>. For limitations and details, see Creating Class Documentation. The description is blank by default.

package (required) is a valid package name, as described in Package Names.

shortclassname (required) is a valid class name. Together, package and shortclassname form the complete class name, which is subject to a length restriction. See Naming Conventions.

superclass_list (optional) specifies the class or classes from which this class inherits. This option, if specified, is either the name of a single class (without the .cls extension) or is a comma-separated list of classes, enclosed in parentheses.

The first such class is referred to as the primary superclass; any additional classes are secondary superclasses. For
information, see Inheritance.

If superclass_list is null, omit the word Extends from the class definition.

class_keyword_list (optional) is a comma-separated list of keywords that (in most cases) affect how the compiler generates code for this class definition.

- See Class Keywords for a complete keyword list.

- If this list is omitted, also omit the square brackets.

- Class_members is zero or more definitions of class members.

- For an introduction, see Kinds of Class Members. See the following sections in this reference for details on class
members:

- Class Definitions and Types

- Class Limits

- Abstract (Class Keyword)

- Specifies whether this is an abstract class.

Usage
To mark a class as abstract, use the following syntax:

Class MyApp.MyClass [ Abstract ] {
//class members
}

Otherwise, omit this keyword or place the word Not immediately before the keyword.

Details
If an object class is Abstract, you cannot create instances of it.

An Abstract class is meant to be the superclass for one or more concrete (non-abstract) classes. An application could contain an abstract Person class, containing attributes, methods, and properties common to all Persons. The non-abstract Employee and Customer classes could inherit from Person, and contain additional methods and properties specific to each.

An Abstract class can also contain abstract methods with a signature only and no code. The subclasses inherit those methods. A developer must then provide code for the method specific to the subclass.

This keyword is not inherited.

Default

If you omit this keyword, the class is not abstract.

- ClassType (Class Keyword)

- ClassType (Class Keyword)

- Specifies the type (or behavior) of this class.

Usage
To specify the type of class (if needed), use the following syntax:

Class MyApp.MyClass [ ClassType = classtype ] {
//class members
}

Where classtype is one of the following:

- datatype — the class is a data type class and is used to represent a literal value.

- dynamic — the class is a dynamic class, such as %DynamicAbstractObject, %DynamicArray, or %DynamicObject.

- index — the class is an index class, a specialized class that defines an inde x interface. For details, see %Library.FunctionalIndex in the class reference.

- persistent — the class represents data to be stored in the database.

- serial — the class represents data to be stored (in its serialized state) in another persistent object.

- stream — the class represents streaming data.

- view — the class is used to define an SQL vie w (see the ViewQuery keyword).

- An empty string, which indicates that this class has no specific type. Abstract classes typically do not specify a class type.

If this keyword is not specified, the class type is inherited from the primary superclass, if there is one.

Note that ClassType is specified for system classes such as %RegisteredObject, %SerialObject, %Persistent, %DynamicAbstractObject, and data type classes, so you do not generally need to specify this keyword if you subclass those classes.

Details
This keyword specifies ho w this class is to be used. The class compiler uses the ClassType keyword to determine how to compile a class. For example, if ClassType is persistent, the class compiler additionally invokes the storage compiler to generate persistence code for a class. Unless explicitly defined, the v alue of ClassType is either the default value or it is inherited from the primary superclass.

For persistent classes, an explicit ClassType statement is only required when standard persistence behavior is being overridden. If a class definition includes such a statement, it is either because a de veloper has specified it or because the class originated in code developed with an older version of InterSystems IRIS.

This keyword is inherited from the primary superclass. The subclass can override the value of the keyword.

Default

If you omit this keyword, the class type is inherited from the primary superclass, if there is one.

Note:

The ClassType for sharded classes cannot have any value other than persistent.

- ClientDataType (Class Keyword)

- ClientDataType (Class Keyword)

- Specifies the client data type used when this data type is projected to client technologies. Applies only to data type classes.

Usage
To specify the client data type to use when this data type is projected to client technologies, use the following syntax:

Class MyApp.MyString [ ClientDataType = clienttype ] {
//class members
}

Where clienttype is one of the following:

- BIGINT

- BINARY

- BINARYSTREAM

- BOOLEAN

- CHARACTERSTREAM

- CURRENCY

- DATE

- DECIMAL

- DOUBLE

- FDATE

- FTIMESTAMP

- HANDLE

- INTEGER

- LIST

- LONGVARCHAR

- NUMERIC

- STATUS

- TIME

- TIMESTAMP

- VARCHAR (default)

Details
This keyword specifies the client data type used when this class is projected to client technologies. Ev ery data type class must specify a client data type.

This keyword is inherited from the primary superclass. The subclass can override the value of the keyword.

Default

The default client data type is VARCHAR.

- ClientName (Class Keyword)

- ClientName (Class Keyword)

- Enables you to override the default class name used in client projections of this class.

Usage
To override the default name for a class when it is projected to a client, use the following syntax:

Class MyApp.MyClass [ ClientName = clientclassname ] {
//class members
}

Where clientclassname is an unquoted string to be used as the client name, instead of the class name.

Details
This keyword lets you define an alternate name for a class when it is projected to a client (such as when using the InterSystems IRIS Java binding).

This keyword is not inherited.

Default

If you omit this keyword, the actual class name is used on the client.

- CompileAfter (Class Keyword)

- Specifies that this class should be compiled after other (specified) classes. In contrast to DependsOn, this keyword does not require the other classes to be runnable.

- Usage
To indicate that the class compiler should compile this class after other classes, use the following syntax:

Class MyApp.MyClass [ CompileAfter = classlist ] {
//class members
}

Where classlist is one of the following:

- A class name. For example:

- [ CompileAfter = MyApp.Class1 ]

A comma-separated list of class names, enclosed in parentheses. For example:

[ CompileAfter = (MyApp.Class1,MyApp.Class2,MyApp.Class3) ]

Details
This keyword specifies that the class compiler should compile this class after compiling the specified classes. This keyword does not ensure the specified classes are runnable before compiling this class. Also, the CompileAfter keyword affects only classes with common values for the System keyword.

Note:

To ensure that a class is compiled after other classes are runnable, instead use the DependsOn keyword. For example, if class A refers to a class query defined in class B, class B must be runnable before class A can be
compiled; in this case, use the DependsOn keyword.

This keyword does not affect runtime behavior.

This keyword is inherited from all superclasses. If the subclass specifies a v alue for the keyword, that value specifies additional classes that must be compiled before the subclass can be compiled.

Default

By default, this keyword is not specified.

System keyword

DependsOn keyword

- DdlAllowed (Class Keyword)

- Specifies whether DDL statements can be used to alter or delete the class definition. Applies only to persistent classes.

- DdlAllowed (Class Keyword)

- Usage
To make it possible to modify a class via DDL, use the following syntax:

- Class MyApp.Person Extends %Persistent [ DdlAllowed ] {
//class members
}

Otherwise, omit this keyword or use the following syntax:

Class MyApp.Person Extends %Persistent [ Not DdlAllowed ] {
//class members
}

Details
This keyword specifies whether DDL statements (such as DR OP TABLE, ALTER TABLE, DROP INDEX, and so on) can be used to alter or delete the class definition.

Typically it is undesirable to enable SQL users to modify classes using DDL statements.

This keyword is not inherited.

Default

If you omit this keyword, DDL statements cannot be used to affect the class definition.

Note

If you create a class by executing a DDL CREATE TABLE statement, the DdlAllowed keyword will initially be set to true for that class.

- DependsOn (Class Keyword)

- Specifies that this class should be compiled after the compiler has made other (specified) classes runnable.

- Usage
To indicate that the class compiler should compile this class after other classes are runnable, use the following syntax:

Class MyApp.MyClass [ DependsOn = classlist ] {
//class members
}

Where classlist is one of the following:

- A class name. For example:

- [ DependsOn = MyApp.Class1 ]

A comma-separated list of class names, enclosed in parentheses. For example:

[ DependsOn = (MyApp.Class1,MyApp.Class2,...) ]

Details
This keyword specifies that the class compiler should compile this class after making the specified classes runnable. F or
example, if class A refers to a class query defined in class B, class B must be runnable before class A can be compiled; in
this case, class A depends on class B.

This keyword is useful if compilation of this class uses these other classes in the method generator logic. It is also useful if the class contains initial expressions that invoke other classes.

This keyword does not affect runtime behavior.

Note:

The DependsOn keyword affects only classes with common values for the System keyword.

Also, if a class has DependsOn=ClassA, it is redundant for it to have CompileAfter=ClassA as well. See the CompileAfter keyword.

This keyword is inherited from all superclasses. If the subclass specifies a v alue for the keyword, that value specifies additional classes that must be runnable before the subclass can be compiled.

Default

By default, this keyword is not specified.

System keyword

CompileAfter keyword

- Deprecated (Class Keyword)

- Specifies that this class is deprecated. This keyword is ignored by the class compiler and merely provides a human-readable indicator that the class is deprecated.

- Deprecated (Class Keyword)

- Usage
To mark a class as deprecated, use the following syntax:

- Class MyApp.MyClass [ Deprecated ] {
//class members
}

Otherwise, omit this keyword or place the word Not immediately before the keyword.

- Final (Class Keyword) Specifies whether this class is final (cannot ha ve subclasses).

Usage
To specify that a class is final, use the follo wing syntax:

Class MyApp.Exam As %Persistent [ Final ] {
//class members
}

Otherwise, omit this keyword or place the word Not immediately before the keyword.

Details
If a class is final , it cannot have subclasses.

Also, if a class is final, the class compiler may tak e advantage of certain code generation optimizations (related to the fact that instances of a final class cannot be used polymorphically).

Default

If you omit this keyword, the class definition is not final.

- GeneratedBy (Class Keyword)

- GeneratedBy (Class Keyword)

- Indicates that this class was generated by code in another class and thus should not be edited.

Usage
The following syntax indicates that this class was generated by code in another class:

Class MyApp.MyClass [ GeneratedBy = MyApp.Generator.cls ] {
//class members
}

Where MyApp.Generator is a fully qualified class name.

Details
If this keyword is specified, your IDE may display the class differently to indicate that it should not be edited. For example, VS Code shows a gear icon in the tab title and in the file tree for a generated class.

This keyword is not inherited.

Default

If you omit this keyword, your IDE displays the class normally.

- Hidden (Class Keyword)

- Specifies whether this class is hidden (not listed in the class reference).

- Usage
To make a class hidden, use the following syntax:

Class MyApp.Person [ Hidden ] {
//class members
}

Otherwise, omit this keyword or place the word Not immediately before the keyword.

Details
If a class is hidden, it is not listed in the class reference, nor in the ObjectScript Explorer pane when using InterSystems ObjectScript extension for VS Code. (It is still possible, however, to open the class if you have saved it to your local VS Code workspace.)

This keyword is not inherited.

Default

If you omit this keyword, the class is not hidden.

- Inheritance (Class Keyword)

- Inheritance (Class Keyword)

- Specifies the inheritance order for the superclasses of this class.

Usage
To specify the inheritance order for the superclasses of this class, use the following syntax:

Class MyApp.MyClass Extends (MySuperClass1, MySuperClass2) [ Inheritance = inheritancedirection ] {
//class members
}

Where inheritancedirection is left or right. You can also omit this keyword; in this case, InterSystems IRIS uses the
default inheritance direction (left).

InterSystems recommends using left inheritance in all new programming.

Details
The Inheritance keyword specifies inheritance order for a class with multiple inheritance. A value of left for inheritancedirection specifies left-to-right inheritance and a v alue of right specifies right-to-left inheritance.

For example, consider class X, which inherits from classes A, B, and C as follows:

Class Definition

Class X Extends (A, B, C)
{
}

The default inheritance order for the class compiler is from left to right, which means that differences in member definitions among superclasses are resolved in favor of the leftmost superclass (in this case, A superseding B and C, and B superseding
C.)

Specifically , for class X, the values of the class parameter values, properties, and methods are inherited from class A (the first superclass listed), then from class B, and, finally , from class C. X also inherits any class members from B that A has not defined, and an y class members from C that neither A nor B has defined. If class B has a class member with the same
name as a member already inherited from A, then X uses the value from A; similarly, if C has a member with the same name
as one inherited from either A or B, the order of precedence is A, then B, then C.

To specify right-to-left inheritance among superclasses, use the Inheritance keyword with a value of right:

Class Definition

Class X Extends (A, B, C) [ Inheritance = right ]
{
}

With right-to-left inheritance, if multiple superclasses have members with the same name, the superclass to the right takes precedence.

Notes on Right Inheritance

Even with right-to-left inheritance, the leftmost superclass (sometimes known as the fir st superclass) is still the primary superclass. This means that the subclass inherits only the class keyword values of its leftmost superclass — there is no override for this behavior.

Also with right-to-left inheritance, when you modify and recompile a superclass, it is necessary to manually recompile the subclasses.

This keyword is not inherited.

Default

If you omit this keyword, the inheritance order is left.

- Multiple Inheritance in Defining Classes

- Language (Class Keyword)

- Language (Class Keyword) Specifies the def ault language used to implement methods for this class.

Usage
To specify the default language used to implement methods in this class, use the following syntax:

Class MyApp.MyClass [ Language = language ] {
//class members
}

Where language is one of the following:

- objectscript — ObjectScript (the default)

- tsql — Transact-SQL Or omit this keyword. In this case, InterSystems IRIS uses the default language (ObjectScript).

Details
This keyword specifies the def ault language used to implement methods for this class. Individual methods can override this value using the method’s Language keyword.

This keyword is not inherited.

Default

If you omit this keyword, the language is ObjectScript.

Note:

You cannot specify Language = ispl or Language = python at the class level; you can only use these
values for methods.

Note:

The default language for methods of a sharded class cannot be any language other than ObjectScript.

- LegacyInstanceContext (Class Keyword)

- Specifies whether instance methods in this class can use the no w-obsolete %this variable.

- Usage
To enable instance methods in the class to use %this, use the following syntax:

Class MyApp.MyClass [ LegacyInstanceContext ] {
//class members
}

Otherwise, omit this keyword or place the word Not immediately before the keyword.

Details
If this keyword is true, instance methods in this class can use the %this variable, which is now obsolete (replaced by $this).
If this keyword is false, instance methods cannot refer to %this.

This keyword is not inherited.

Default

If you omit this keyword, instance methods cannot refer to %this.

- NoExtent (Class Keyword)

- NoExtent (Class Keyword)

- Specifies whether the compiler is pre vented from generating a storage definition and methods to sa ve/load object from disk and to disk.

Usage
To prevent the compiler from generating a storage definition and methods to sa ve/load object from disk and to disk, use
the following syntax:

Class MyApp.MyClass [ NoExtent ] {
//class members
}

Otherwise, omit this keyword or place the word Not immediately before the keyword.

Details
If this keyword is true, the compiler does not generate a storage definition and methods to sa ve/load object from disk and to disk. You cannot save instances of such a class. Frequently, such classes extend or override the standard persistent interface inherited from %Library.Persistent.

This keyword is not inherited.

Default

If you omit this keyword, the class compiler will generate a storage definition and methods to sa ve/load object from disk and to disk (if applicable).

- OdbcType (Class Keyword)

- Specifies the type used when this data type is e xposed via ODBC or JDBC. Every data type class must specify an ODBC type. This keyword applies only to data type classes.

- Usage
To specify the type to use when this data type is projected via ODBC or JDBC, use the following syntax:

Class MyApp.MyString [ ClassType = DataType, OdbcType = odbctype ] {
//class members
}

Where odbctype is one of the following:

- BIGINT

- BIT

- DATE

- DOUBLE

- INTEGER

- LONGVARBINARY

- LONGVARCHAR

- NUMERIC

- RESULTSET

- SMALLINT

- STRUCT

- TIME

- TIMESTAMP

- TINYINT

- VARBINARY

- VARCHAR (default)

Details
This keyword specifies the type used when e xposed via ODBC or JDBC.

Every data type class must specify an ODBC type.

This keyword is inherited from the primary superclass. The subclass can override the value of the keyword.

Default

If you omit this keyword, the ODBC type is VARCHAR.

- OdbcType (Class Keyword)

- Owner (Class Keyword)

- Specifies the o wner of this class and its corresponding table. Applies only to persistent classes.

Usage
To specify the owner of this class and its corresponding table, use the following syntax:

Class MyApp.Person Extends %Persistent [ Owner = {"username"} ] {
//class members
}

Where username is an InterSystems IRIS user name.

Details
This keyword specifies the o wner of the class and its corresponding table.

This keyword is inherited from the primary superclass. The subclass can override the value of the keyword.

Default

If you omit this keyword, this class and its table are owned by the _SYSTEM user.

- ProcedureBlock (Class Keyword)

- ProcedureBlock (Class Keyword)

- Specifies whether each ObjectScript method in this class is a procedure block by def ault.

Usage
To cause the ObjectScript methods in this class to be procedure blocks by default, either omit this keyword or use the fol-
lowing syntax:

Class MyApp.MyClass [ ProcedureBlock ] {
//class members
}

Otherwise, use the following syntax:

Class MyApp.MyClass [ Not ProcedureBlock ] {
//class members
}

Details
This keyword specifies whether ObjectScript methods in this class are procedure blocks by def ault. You can override this for an individual methods by setting the ProcedureBlock keyword for the method.

This keyword is ignored for methods written in other languages.

Within ObjectScript, methods can be implemented as procedure blocks or not. Procedure blocks enforce variable scoping:
methods cannot see variables defined by their caller . New applications use procedure blocks; non-procedure blocks exist
for backwards compatibility.

This keyword is not inherited.

Default

If you omit this keyword, each ObjectScript method in this class is a procedure block (unless you override that for individual methods).

- PropertyClass (Class Keyword)

- Adds property parameters to this class.

- Usage
To add property parameters to this class, use the following syntax:

Class PropClass.MyClass Extends %RegisteredObject [ PropertyClass = PropClass.MyPropertyClass ] {
//class members
}

Where propertyclasslist is one of the following:

- A fully qualified class name . For example:

- [ PropertyClass = PropClass.MyPropertyClass ] A comma-separated list of fully qualified class names, enclosed in parentheses.

Details
If you need to add custom property parameters, do the following:

1. Define and compile a class that defines one or more class parameters. F or example:

Class PropClass.MyPropertyClass
{

Parameter MYPARAM As %String = "XYZ";

}

These class parameters become property parameters in the next step.

2.

In the class that defines the properties, specify the PropertyClass k eyword.

Subclasses inherit the custom behavior added by this keyword. If the subclass specifies a v alue for the keyword, that value specifies an additional class or classes that specify parameters for properties of this class.

- ServerOnly (Class Keyword)

- ServerOnly (Class Keyword)

- Specifies whether this class is projected to Ja va clients.

Usage
To override the default way that the class would be projected to Java clients, use the following syntax:

Class Sample.NewClass1 [ ServerOnly = serveronlyvalue ] {
//class members
}

Where serveronlyvalue is one of the following:

- 0 means that this class can be projected.

- 1 means that this class will not be projected.

Details
If this keyword is 1, the class will not be projected to a Java client. If this keyword is 0, the class will be projected.

This keyword is not inherited.

Default

If this keyword is omitted, this class is projected if it is not a stub (but is not projected if it is a stub).

- Sharded (Class Keyword)

- Specifies whether this class is sharded. Applies only to persistent classes in an environment containing a sharded cluster.

- Usage
To define a class as sharded, use the follo wing syntax:

Class MyApp.MyClass Extends %Persistent [ Sharded = 1 ] {
//class members
}

Otherwise, omit this keyword.

Details
Sharding is a mechanism for horizontally scaling data storage. If a class is sharded, instances of the class are distributed across any defined data nodes in the sharded cluster .

If you have a sharded environment and you define a class as not being sharded, the instances of that class are stored on the first data node only , though the data is visible to all of the nodes.

This keyword is inherited.

Default

If you omit this keyword, the class is not sharded.

- Horizontally Scaling for Data Volume with Sharding

- Specifies the binding style or SO AP invocation mechanism used by any web methods defined in this class. Applies only in a class that is defined as a web service or web client.

- Usage
To specify the binding style used by any web methods defined in this class, use the follo wing syntax:

- Class MyApp.MyClass [ SoapBindingStyle = soapbindingstyle ] {
//class members
}

Where soapbindingstyle is one of the following:

- document (default) — Web methods in this class use document-style binding by default.

With this binding style, the SOAP messages are formatted as documents and typically have only one part.

In the SOAP messages, the <Body> element typically contains a single child element. Each child of the <Body> element corresponds to a message part.

- rpc — Web methods in this class use RPC (remote procedure call)-style binding by default.

With this binding style, the SOAP messages are formatted as messages with multiple parts.

In the SOAP messages, the <Body> element contains a single child element whose name is taken from the corresponding operation name. This element is a generated wrapper element, and it contains one child element for each argument in the argument list of the method.

If SoapBindingStyle is document and if ARGUMENTSTYLE is message, then the message style is very similar to RPC;
see Creating Web Services and Web Clients.

Important:

For a web service that you create manually, the default value of this keyword is usually suitable. When you generate a web client or service from a WSDL, InterSystems IRIS sets this keyword as appropriate
for that WSDL; if you modify the value, your web client or service may no longer work.

Details
This keyword lets you specify the default binding style used by any web methods defined in this class. It af fects the format of the SOAP body (but not any SOAP headers).

You can override the binding style for individual methods, by using the SoapBindingStyle method keyword or the Soap- BindingStyle query keyword.

This keyword is not inherited.

Default

The default value is document. (Chapter 7 of the SOAP standard v1.1, Using SOAP for RPC, specifies that web methods should use RPC-style binding. However, most SOAP clients, including .NET, use document-style binding.)

The SoapBindingStyle class keyword specifies the v alue of the style attribute of <soap:binding> element within the
<binding> section of the WSDL. For example, if SoapBindingStyle is document, the WSDL could look as follows:

... <binding ...> <soap:binding ... style="document"/> <operation ...> <soap:operation ... style="document"/> ...

As shown here, the SoapBindingStyle class keyword also specifies the def ault value of the style attribute of the
<soap:operation> element, within the <binding> section of the WSDL; this attribute is further controlled by the
SoapBindingStyle method keyword.

In contrast, if SoapBindingStyle is rpc, the WSDL could instead be as follows:

... <binding ...> <soap:binding ... style="rpc"/> <operation ...> <soap:operation ... style="rpc"/> ...

The binding style also affects the <message> elements, as follows:

- If the binding style is document, a message has only one part by default. For example:

<message name="AddSoapIn"> <part name="parameters" .../> </message>

If the ARGUMENTSTYLE parameter is message, then a message can have multiple parts. For example:

<message name="AddSoapIn"> <part name="a" .../> <part name="b" .../> </message>

- If the binding style is rpc, a message can have multiple parts. For example:

<message name="AddSoapIn"> <part name="a" .../> <part name="b" .../> </message>

The primary effect on SOAP messages is to control whether the SOAP body can contain multiple subelements.

For a web method that uses a RPC-style binding and encoded-style messages, the following shows an example of the body
of a possible request message:

XML

<SOAP-ENV:Body SOAP-ENV:encodingStyle='http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/'> <types:Add> <a href="#id1" /><b href="#id2" /> </types:Add> <types:ComplexNumber id="id1" xsi:type="types:ComplexNumber"> <Real xsi:type="s:double">10</Real> <Imaginary xsi:type="s:double">5</Imaginary> </types:ComplexNumber> <types:ComplexNumber id="id2" xsi:type="types:ComplexNumber"> <Real xsi:type="s:double">17</Real> <Imaginary xsi:type="s:double">2</Imaginary> </types:ComplexNumber>
</SOAP-ENV:Body>

In contrast, the following shows an example of the body of a possible request message for a web method that uses literal
binding and encoded-style messages:

XML

<SOAP-ENV:Body>
<tns:Add> <tns:a xsi:type="tns:ComplexNumber"> <Real xsi:type="s:double">10</Real> <Imaginary xsi:type="s:double">5</Imaginary> </tns:a> <tns:b xsi:type="tns:ComplexNumber"> <Real xsi:type="s:double">17</Real> <Imaginary xsi:type="s:double">2</Imaginary> </tns:b> </tns:Add>
</SOAP-ENV:Body>

In this case, the SOAP body has a single subelement.

Use With %XML.DataSet

For objects of type %XML.DataSet, not all permutations of the SoapBindingStyle and SoapBodyUse keywords are permitted,
as the following table summarizes:

SoapBindingStyle=document(default)

supported

SoapBindingStyle=rpc

supported

not supported

supported

SoapBodyUse=literal (default)

SoapBodyUse=encoded

- SoapBodyUse (Class Keyword)

- Specifies the encoding for an y web methods defined in this class. This keyword applies only to web service and web client classes.

- Usage
To specify the encoding used by the inputs and outputs of the web methods of this class, use the following syntax:

- Class MyApp.MyClass [ SoapBodyUse = soapbodyuse ] {
//class members
}

Where soapbodyuse is one of the following:

- literal (default) — Web methods in this class use literal data by default. That is, the XML within the <Body> of the SOAP message exactly matches the schema given in the WSDL.

- encoded — Web methods in this class use SOAP-encoded data by default. That is, the XML within the <Body> of the SOAP message uses SOAP encoding as appropriate for the SOAP version being used, as required by the following
specifications:

–

–

SOAP 1.1 (https://www.w3.org/TR/2000/NOTE-SOAP-20000508/)

SOAP 1.2 (https://www.w3.org/TR/soap12-part2/)

Important:

For a web service that you create manually, the default value of this keyword is usually suitable. When you generate a web client or service from a WSDL, InterSystems IRIS sets this keyword as appropriate
for that WSDL; if you modify the value, your web client or service may no longer work.

Details
This keyword specifies the def ault encoding used by any web methods defined in this class. It also controls the def ault values for the ELEMENTQUALIFIED and XMLELEMENT parameters for this class, as discussed in a subsection of this topic.

You can override this keyword for individual methods, by using the SoapBodyUse method keyword or the SoapBodyUse query keyword.

This keyword is not inherited.

Default

The default value is literal. (The SOAP standard v1.1 (Chapter 5) specifies that web methods should use SO AP encoding. However, most SOAP clients, including .NET, use literal style.)

The SoapBodyUse keyword specifies the v alue of the use attribute of the <soap:body> element within the <binding>
section of the WSDL. For example, if SoapBodyUse is literal, the WSDL could look as follows:

SoapBodyUse (Class Keyword)

... <binding name="MyServiceNameSoap" ... <soap:binding ... <operation name="Add"> <soap:operation ...> <input> <soap:body use="literal"/> </input> <output> <soap:body use="literal"/> </output> </operation> </binding> ...

In contrast, if SoapBodyUse is encoded, the WSDL could instead be as follows:

... <binding name="MyServiceNameSoap" ... <soap:binding ... <operation name="Add"> <soap:operation .../> <input> <soap:body use="encoded" namespace="http://www.mynamespace.org" encodingStyle="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/"/> </input> <output> <soap:body use="encoded" namespace="http://www.mynamespace.org" encodingStyle="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/"/> </output>

</operation> </binding> ...

For SOAP 1.2, the encodingStyle attribute is as follows instead:

encodingStyle="http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-encoding"

The SoapBodyUse keyword also determines the contents of a <part> element of a <message> element for each web
method:

- If SoapBodyUse is literal, each <part> element includes an element attribute. For example:

<part name="parameters" element="s0:Add"/>

For another example:

<part name="b" element="s0:b"/>

- If SoapBodyUse is encoded, each <part> element includes a type attribute rather than an element attribute. For
example:

<part name="a" type="s0:ComplexNumber"/>

Note that SoapBodyUse also controls the default values for the ELEMENTQUALIFIED and XMLELEMENT parameters, which also affect the WSDL.

For a web method that uses a document-style message, the web service sends a response message like the following:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?> <SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV='http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/' xmlns:xsi='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance' xmlns:s='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema'>
<SOAP-ENV:Body>
<AddResponse ...>
...

In contrast, for a web service that uses an encoded-style message, the response message would be as follows:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?> <SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV='http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/' xmlns:xsi='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance' xmlns:s='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema' xmlns:SOAP-ENC='http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/' xmlns:tns='http://www.mynamespace.org' xmlns:types='http://www.mynamespace.org'> <SOAP-ENV:Body SOAP-ENV:encodingStyle='http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/'> <types:AddResponse> ...

Effect on Default for Parameters of the Web Service or Web Client

The default value for the ELEMENTQUALIFIED parameter depends on the SoapBodyUse keyword:

Value of
SoapBodyUse

literal

encoded

Default for ELEMENTQUALIFIED

Notes

elementFormDefault="qualified"

elementFormDefault="unqualified"

The default value for the XMLELEMENT parameter also depends on the SoapBodyUse keyword:

Value of
SoapBodyUse

literal

encoded

Default for XMLELEMENT

Notes

Message parts have the element attribute

Message parts have the type attribute

For details on the ELEMENTQUALIFIED and XMLELEMENT parameters, see Projecting Objects to XML.

For objects of type %XML.DataSet, not all permutations of the SoapBindingStyle and SoapBodyUse keywords are permitted. See the entry for the SoapBindingStyle class keyword.

- SqlCategory (Class Keyword)

- SqlCategory (Class Keyword)

- Specifies the type to use for calculations in SQL. Applies only to data type classes.

- Usage
To specify the type to use for calculations in SQL, use the following syntax:

Class MyApp.MyString [ ClassType = DataType, SQLCategory = STRING ] {
//class members
}

Where sqlcategory is one of the following:

- DATE

- DOUBLE

- FMDATE

- FMTIMESTAMP

- INTEGER

- MVDATE

- NAME

- NUMERIC

- STRING (default)

- TIME

- TIMESTAMP

Details
This keyword specifies the type to use for this class in SQL calculations.

Every data type class must specify an SQL category.

When creating a new data type class, use the SQL category value that most closely matches the data type you are creating, or, better still, subclass an existing data type class and inherit its SQL category.

This keyword is inherited from the primary superclass. The subclass can override the value of the keyword.

Default

The default SQL category is STRING.

- SqlRowIdName (Class Keyword)

- Overrides the default SQL field name for the ID column for this class. Applies only to persistent classes.

- Usage
To override the default SQL field name for the ID column of this class, use the follo wing syntax:

Class MyApp.MyClass [ SqlRowIdName = MyId ] {
//class members
}

Where MyId is an SQL identifier .

Details
This keyword overrides the default SQL field name used for the ID column.

When a persistent class is projected as an SQL table, the Object Identity value for each object is projected as an SQL column — the Row ID column. By default, the Row ID column is called ID. If the class has another field named used (and so on). The SqlRowIdName keyword lets you set the name of the Row ID column directly.

ID, then ID1 is

This keyword is inherited from the primary superclass. The subclass can override the value of the keyword.

Default

If you omit this keyword, the SQL field name for the ID column for this class is ID

- SqlRowIdPrivate (Class Keyword)

- SqlRowIdPrivate (Class Keyword)

- Specifies whether the ID column for this class is a hidden field when projected to ODBC and JDBC. Applies only to persistent classes.

Usage
To hide the ID column when projecting the table to ODBC and JDBC, use the following syntax:

Class MyApp.MyClass [ SqlRowIdPrivate ] {
//class members
}

Otherwise, omit this keyword or place the word Not immediately before the keyword.

Details
If this keyword is true, the ID column is a hidden field when the table is projected to ODBC and JDBC.

When a persistent class is projected as an SQL table, the Object Identity value for each object is projected as an SQL column — the Row ID column. The SqlRowIdPrivate keyword lets you specify whether this Row ID column should be hidden
from ODBC and JDBC-based queries. If the row ID column is hidden:

- It is not reported as a column by the various catalog queries

- It is not included in the SELECT * query.

An ODBC or JDBC client can select this column if the query explicitly lists the column within the SELECT clause. (Note that by definition, you cannot use a Ro w ID column in an UPDATE or INSERT statement because the value of the Row ID cannot be modified or directly set).

Typically you use this keyword for cases where you are dealing with legacy relational data and do not want the Row ID column to be seen by reporting tools.

This keyword is not inherited.

Default

If you omit this keyword, the ID column is visible normally when the table is projected to ODBC and JDBC.

- SqlTableName (Class Keyword)

- Specifies the name of the SQL table to which this class is projected. Applies only to persistent classes.

- Usage
To override the default name of the SQL table to which this class is projected, use the following syntax:

Class MyApp.Person Extends %Persistent [ SqlTableName = DBTable ] {
//class members
}

Where DBTable is a valid SQL identifier .

Note that the schema or package name is still prepended to the name of the table specified SqlTableName In the example above, the table would be identified as MyApp.DBTable.

Details
This keyword specifies the name of the SQL table to which this class is projected. By def ault, the SQL table name is the same as the class name.

Typically you use this keyword when the class name is a SQL reserved word (not uncommon) or if you want the SQL table to contain characters not supported by class names (such as the _ character).

This keyword is not inherited.

Default

If you omit this keyword, the class name is used as the SQL table name.

- StorageStrategy (Class Keyword)

- StorageStrategy (Class Keyword)

- Specifies which storage definition controls persistence for this class. Applies only to persistent and serial classes.

Usage
To specify which storage definition the class uses, use syntax lik e the following:

Class MyApp.MyClass Extends %Persistent [ StorageStrategy = MyStorage ] {
//class members
}

Where MyStorage is the name of a storage definition in this class.

Details
This keyword specifies which storage definition is used to define the storage structure used by this class.

Typically you do not worry about this keyword or about storage structures; the class compiler will automatically define a
storage structure named Default and maintain it (add new fields as appropriate) for you. It is possible to create more than one storage definition for a class. In this case, this k eyword is used to specify which storage definition the class compiler should use.

This keyword is inherited from the primary superclass. The subclass can override the value of the keyword.

Default

If you omit this keyword, the persistence for this class is defined by the def ault storage definition, named Default.

- System (Class Keyword)

- Influences the compilation order for this class.

- Usage
To influence the compilation order for a class, use syntax lik e the following:

Class MyApp.Person Extends %Persistent [ System = n ] {
//class members
}

Where n is an integer ranging from 0 to 4, where classes with the lower positive values are compiled before classes with higher positive values. Classes with values of 0 (zero) are compiled last.

Details
This keyword establishes groups of classes, each associated with a different value and priority, where the full class compilation process occurs for each priority level before moving on to the subsequent priority level. From highest priority to
lowest priority, the levels are:

- 0 (the default)

- Class compilation has two steps:

- 1. Resolving the globals.

- 2. Compiling the routines.

- All classes with the same value of the System keyword have their globals resolved before routine compilation. With classes of varying levels, those of higher priority have both resolved globals and compiled routines before those of lower priority have their globals resolved.

The CompileAfter and DependsOn keywords work within the classes with a common System value to determine the order of global resolution. Once all classes with a common System value have had their globals resolved, then routine compilation proceeds for all of them.

Hence, if class B needs to run a method of class A in class B’s method generator (that is, during compilation of B), then A must have a higher priority than B. This means that the value for A’s System keyword must be a non-zero integer that is lower than the value for B. To obtain this behavior, CompileAfter or DependsOn do not work.

This keyword is not inherited.

Default

The default value is 0 (zero).

- System (Class Keyword)

- ViewQuery (Class Keyword)

- Specifies the SQL query for this class. Applies only to view definition classes.

Usage
To specify the SQL query for this class, use the following syntax:

ViewQuery = { statement }

Where statement is an SQL SELECT statement, enclosed in curly braces.

Details
When you define an SQL vie w (using the DDL CREATE VIEW statement or using the Management Portal), the system automatically creates a class definition to hold the vie w definition. F or this class definition, ClassType is view, and ViewQuery equals the SQL statement on which the view is based.

This mechanism is internal; users are not expected to create view classes nor to modify the ViewQuery keyword. Instead,
use the normal mechanisms (DDL or the Management Portal) for managing views.

This keyword is ignored for all non-view classes.

Default

The default value is an empty string.

- This reference describes the syntax and keywords that apply to a foreign key.

- Syntax of Foreign Keys in Class Definitions

- Describes the structure of a foreign key definition.

Introduction
A foreign key defines a referential inte grity constraint. When a table containing a foreign key constraint is modified, the foreign key constraints are checked.

You can add foreign key definitions to persistent classes. They are not meaningful in other kinds of classes.

Note that you can also enforce reference integrity by defining relationship properties that connect the classes.

Details
A foreign key definition has the follo wing structure:

/// description
ForeignKey name(key_props) References referenced_class(ref_index) [ keyword_list ];

Where:

- description (optional) is intended for display in the Class Reference. The description is blank by default. See Creating
Class Documentation.

- name (required) is the name of the foreign key. This must be a valid class member name, and must not conflict with any other class member names.

- key_props (required) specifies the property or properties that are constrained by this foreign k ey. Specifically this property or properties must match the referenced value in the foreign table.

- This is a comma-separated list of property names.

- These properties must be in the same class that defines the foreign k ey.

- referenced_class (required) specifies the foreign table (that is, the class to which the foreign k ey points).

ref_index (optional) specifies the unique inde x name within referenced_class.

If you omit ref_index, then the system uses the IDKEY index in referenced_class.

keyword_list (optional) is a comma-separated list of keywords that further define the foreign k ey.

See Foreign Key Syntax and Keywords for a complete keyword list.

If this list is omitted, also omit the square brackets.

Example

ForeignKey EmpKey(EmpId) References MyApp.Employee(EmpIDX) [ OnDelete = cascade ];

In this example, EmpIDX is the unique index name in the class MyApp.Employee.

Class Limits

- Internal (Foreign Key Keyword)

- Internal (Foreign Key Keyword) Specifies whether this foreign key definition is internal (not displayed in the class documentation).

Usage
To mark this foreign key definition as internal, use the follo wing syntax:

ForeignKey keyname(key_props) References pkg.class(ref_index) [ Internal ];

Otherwise, omit this keyword or place the word Not immediately before the keyword.

Details
Internal class members are not displayed in the class documentation. This keyword is useful if you want users to see a class but not see all its members.

Default

If you omit this keyword, this foreign key definition is displayed in the class documentation.

- NoCheck (Foreign Key Keyword)

- Specifies whether InterSystems IRIS should check this foreign key constraint.

- Usage
To prevent InterSystems IRIS from checking the constraint defined by this foreign k ey, use the following syntax:

ForeignKey keyname(key_props) References pkg.class(ref_index) [ NoCheck ];

Otherwise, omit this keyword or place the word Not immediately before the keyword.

Details
The NoCheck keyword suppresses the checking of the foreign key constraint (in other words, it specifies that the foreign key constraint never be checked).

Default

If you omit this keyword, InterSystems IRIS does check the foreign key constraint.

- OnDelete (Foreign Key Keyword)

- OnDelete (Foreign Key Keyword)

- Specifies the action that this foreign key should cause in the current table when a record deleted in the foreign table is referenced by a record in the current table.

Usage
To specify what happens in the current table when a referenced record is deleted in the foreign table, use the following
syntax:

ForeignKey keyname(key_props) References pkg.class(ref_index) [ OnDelete = ondelete ];

Where ondelete is one of the following:

- noaction (default) — When an attempt is made to delete a referenced record in the foreign table, the attempt fails.

- cascade — When a referenced record is deleted in the foreign table, the referencing record in this table is also deleted.

- setdefault — When a referenced record is deleted in the foreign table, the reference to the foreign table in the referencing record is set to its default value.

- setnull — When a referenced record is deleted in the foreign table, the reference to the foreign table in the referencing record is set to null.

Description
When a row is deleted in the foreign table, all referencing tables with a foreign key constraint on the foreign table are checked to see if any row references the row being deleted. If any such references are found, the OnDelete action takes effect.

Default

The default is noaction.

- Defining a F oreign Key in the InterSystems SQL Reference

- OnUpdate (Foreign Key Keyword)

- Specifies the action that this foreign key should cause in the current table when the key value of a record in the foreign table is updated and that record is referenced by a record in the current table.

- Usage
To specify what happens in the current table when the key value of a referenced record is updated in the foreign table, use
the following syntax:

ForeignKey keyname(key_props) References pkg.class(ref_index) [ OnUpdate = onupdate ];

Where onupdate is one of the following:

- noaction (default) — When an attempt is made to update the key value of a referenced record in the foreign table, the attempt fails.

- cascade — When the key value of a referenced record is updated in the foreign table, the reference to the foreign table in the referencing record is also updated.

- setdefault — When the key value of a referenced record is updated in the foreign table, the reference to the foreign table in the referencing record is set to its default value.

- setnull — When the key value of a referenced record is updated in the foreign table, the reference to the foreign table in the referencing record is set to null.

Details
When the key value of a row in the foreign table is updated, all referencing tables with a foreign key constraint on the foreign table are checked to see if any row references the row being updated. If any such references are found, the OnUpdate action takes effect.

Default

The default is noaction.

Defining a F oreign Key in the InterSystems SQL Reference

- SqlName (Foreign Key Keyword)

- SqlName (Foreign Key Keyword)

- Specifies an SQL alias for the foreign key.

- Usage
To override the default SQL name for this foreign key, use the following syntax:

ForeignKey keyname(key_props) References pkg.class(ref_index) [ SqlName = alternate_name ];

Where alternate_name is an SQL identifier .

Details
This keyword lets you define an alternate name for this foreign k ey when referred to via SQL.

Default

If you omit this keyword, the SQL name for the foreign key is keyname as specified in the foreign k ey definition.

- This reference describes the syntax and keywords that apply to an index, which you can define in persistent classes.

- Syntax of Indexes in Class Definitions

- Describes the structure of an index definition.

Introduction
An index is a structure maintained by a persistent class that is intended to be used to optimize queries and other functions. These indexes are automatically maintained whenever INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE SQL-based operations are carried
out against the database; likewise for object-based actions. The SQL Query Processor makes use of available indexes when
preparing and executing SQL queries.

You can add index definitions to persistent classes. They are not meaningful in other kinds of classes.

Details
An index definition has the follo wing structure:

/// description
Index name On property_expression_list [ keyword_list ];

Where:

- description (optional) is intended for display in the Class Reference. The description is blank by default. See Creating
Class Documentation.

- name (required) is the name of the index. The name must follow property naming conventions and be unique within this class or table.

- This name is used for database administrative purposes (reporting, index building, dropping indexes, and so on). For information on property naming conventions, see Class Members. For information on the relationship between an index name in a class definition and the corresponding SQL inde x name, see CREATE INDEX.

Tip:

It is useful to follow a naming convention so that indexes can be easily distinguished from properties. For example, you could include IDX at the end of all index names.

property_expression_list (required) specifies the property or properties on which the inde x is based and may also include a collation specification for each property . This option is either a single property expression or a comma-separated list of property expressions, enclosed in parentheses.

A given property expression consists of:

–

The name of the property to be indexed.

– An optional (ELEMENTS) or (KEYS) expression, which provides a means of indexing on collection subvalues.

– An optional collation expression.

For more details, see Define and Build Inde xes.

- keyword_list (optional) is a comma-separated list of keywords that further define the inde x.

See Index Syntax and Keywords for a complete keyword list.

If this list is omitted, also omit the square brackets.

For example, the following class definition defines tw o properties and an index based on each of them:

Syntax of Indexes in Class Definitions

Class Definition

Class MyApp.Student Extends %Persistent
{

Property Name As %String;

Property GPA As %Double;

Index NameIDX On Name;

Index GPAIDX On GPA;
}

- Class Limits

- Abstract (Index Keyword) Specifies that an index is abstract.

Usage
To specify that an index is abstract, use the following syntax:

Index name [ Abstract ];

Where name is the name of the index. It is useful to follow a naming convention so that indexes can be easily distinguished from properties. For example, you could include IDX at the end of all index names.

Note: When you create a sharded table, an abstract shard key index is generated automatically and there is no need to

define one.

Details
Abstract indexes are intended for use only with sharded tables. They contain no data and thus have no storage (no index global). A sharded table has exactly one abstract index, called the shard key index. The purpose of a shard key index is to serve as the key that determines the shard in which a row resides.

If an index is defined as abstract, the inde x is not accessible or usable via methods or via SQL. If you also try to mark this index as unique or try to use it within a primary key, those constraints are ignored.

You cannot define an IdK ey index as abstract. If you attempt to do so, a class compilation error will result.

You can use this keyword on an existing index to make it abstract. This will not delete any existing data in the index.

Default

The default for the Abstract keyword is false.

- Condition (Index Keyword)

- Condition (Index Keyword) Defines a conditional index and specifies the condition that must be met for a record to be included in the inde x.

Usage
This keyword is for migrating existing applications to InterSystems SQL and is not for use in new applications.

- CoshardWith (Index Keyword)

- Adds an index that specifies the name of the class with which this class is cosharded.

Usage
Until sharded classes are fully implemented, InterSystems recommends creating sharded tables from SQL, not from the
object side. However, if you look at a class generated by creating a sharded table, you may see code such as the following:

/// ShardKey index for Sharded table, auto-generated by DDL CREATE TABLE statement
Index ShardKey On DeptNum [ Abstract, CoshardWith = User.Department, ShardKey, SqlName = %ShardKey ];

In this example, the current class is cosharded with the User.Department class.

- Horizontally Scaling InterSystems IRIS for Data Volume with Sharding

- Data (Index Keyword)

- Data (Index Keyword) Specifies a list of properties whose v alues are to be stored within this index.

Usage
To store values of properties within an index, use the following syntax:

Index name On property_expression_list [ Data = stored_property_list ];

Where:

- name is the name of the index. It is useful to follow a naming convention so that indexes can be easily distinguished from properties. For example, you could include IDX at the end of all index names.

- stored_property_list is either a single property name or a comma-separated list of properties, enclosed in parentheses.

Details
This keyword specifies a list of properties whose v alues are to be stored within this index.

You cannot use this keyword with a bitmap index.

Refer to the documentation on indexes for more details.

Default

If you omit this keyword, values of properties are not stored within the index.

Example

Index NameIDX On Name [ Data = Name ];

Index ZipIDX On ZipCode [ Data = (City,State) ];

- Extent (Index Keyword)

- Defines an e xtent index.

Usage
To specify that this is an extent index, use the following syntax:

Index name [ Extent ];

Where name is the name of the index. It is useful to follow a naming convention so that indexes can be easily distinguished from properties. For example, you could include IDX at the end of all index names.

Otherwise, omit this keyword or place the word Not immediately before the keyword.

Note:

If you are using bitmap indexes, then an extent index is automatically added and there is no need to define one.

Details
An extent index is used to keep track of which object instances belong to a subclass.

Default

The default for the Extent keyword is false.

- IdKey (Index Keyword)

- IdKey (Index Keyword) Specifies whether this index defines the Object Identity v alues for the table.

Usage
To specify that the Object Identity values for this table should be formed from the property or properties on which this
index is based, use the following syntax:

Index name On property_expression_list [ IdKey ];

Where:

- name is the name of the index. It is useful to follow a naming convention so that indexes can be easily distinguished from properties. For example, you could include IDX at the end of all index names.

- property_expression_list is either a single property name or a comma-separated list of properties, enclosed in parentheses.

Otherwise, omit this keyword or place the word Not immediately before the keyword.

Details
This keyword specifies that the property or properties on which this inde x is based will be used to form the Object Identity value for this object.

Note that creating a custom IdKey index impacts how data is physically stored and may limit the availability of other index options. See RowID Field and Master Map.

Important:

There must not be a sequential pair of vertical bars (||) within the values of any property used by an IDKEY index, unless that property is a valid reference to an instance of a persistent class. This restriction is imposed by the way in which the InterSystems SQL mechanism works. The use of || in IDKey properties can result in unpredictable behavior.

The Object Identity value is used to uniquely locate persistent object instances. Once an object using IdKey has been saved, you cannot modify the values of any of the properties that make up the IdKey.

An IdKey index also behaves like a unique index. That is, for the property (or the combination of properties) that you use in this index, InterSystems IRIS enforces uniqueness. It is permitted, but redundant, to specify the Unique keyword as true in this index definition.

For an IdKey index, InterSystems IRIS generates methods that you can use to open objects, check existence of objects, and
delete objects; see Open, Exists, and Delete Methods.

Default

The default for the IdKey keyword is false.

- Internal (Index Keyword)

- Specifies whether this

- index definition is internal (not displayed in the class documentation).

Usage
To specify that this index definition is internal, use the follo wing syntax:

Index name On property_expression_list [ Internal ];

Where:

- name is the name of the index. It is useful to follow a naming convention so that indexes can be easily distinguished from properties. For example, you could include IDX at the end of all index names.

- property_expression_list is either a single property name or a comma-separated list of properties, enclosed in parentheses.

Otherwise, omit this keyword or place the word Not immediately before the keyword.

Details
Internal class members are not displayed in the class documentation. This keyword is useful if you want users to see a class but not see all its members.

Default

If you omit this keyword, this index is displayed in the class documentation.

- PrimaryKey (Index Keyword)

- PrimaryKey (Index Keyword) Specifies whether this index defines the primary k ey for the table.

Usage
To specify that the primary key for this table is formed by the properties on which this index is based, use the following
syntax:

Index name On property_expression_list [ PrimaryKey ];

Where:

- name is the name of the index. It is useful to follow a naming convention so that indexes can be easily distinguished from properties. For example, you could include IDX at the end of all index names.

- property_expression_list is either a single property name or a comma-separated list of properties, enclosed in parentheses.

Otherwise, omit this keyword or place the word Not immediately before the keyword.

Details
This keyword specifies that this inde x should be reported, via SQL, as being the primary key for this class (table).

A PrimaryKey index also behaves like a unique index. That is, for the property (or the combination of properties) that you use in this index, InterSystems IRIS enforces uniqueness. It is permitted, but redundant, to specify the Unique keyword as true in this index definition.

For a primary key index, InterSystems IRIS generates methods that you can use to open objects, check existence of objects,
and delete objects; see Open, Exists, and Delete Methods.

Example

Class Member

Index EmpIDX On EmployeeID [ PrimaryKey] ;

Default

If you omit this keyword, the primary key for this table is not formed by the properties on which this index is based.

- ShardKey (Index Keyword)

- Defines an index that specifies the shard k ey for this class.

- Usage
Until sharded classes are fully implemented, InterSystems recommends creating sharded tables from SQL, not from the
object side. However, if you look at a class generated by creating a sharded table, you may see code such as the following:

/// ShardKey index for Sharded table, auto-generated by DDL CREATE TABLE statement
Index ShardKey On DeptNum [ Abstract, CoshardWith = User.Department, ShardKey, SqlName = %ShardKey ];

In this example, the DeptNum property is the shard key of the current class.

- Horizontally Scaling InterSystems IRIS for Data Volume with Sharding

- SqlName (Index Keyword)

- SqlName (Index Keyword) Specifies an SQL alias for the index.

Usage
To override the default name for this index when referred to via SQL, use the following syntax:

Index name On property_expression_list [ SqlName = sqlindexname];

Where:

- name is the name of the index. It is useful to follow a naming convention so that indexes can be easily distinguished from properties. For example, you could include IDX at the end of all index names.

- property_expression_list is either a single property name or a comma-separated list of properties, enclosed in parentheses.

- sqlindexname is an SQL identifier .

Details
This keyword lets you define an alternate name for this inde x when referred to via SQL.

Default

If you omit this keyword, the SQL name of the index is indexname as given in the index definition.

- Type (Index Keyword)

- Specifies the type of index.

Usage
To specify the type of the index, use the following syntax:

Index name On property_expression_list [ Type = indextype ];

Where:

- name is the name of the index. It is useful to follow a naming convention so that indexes can be easily distinguished from properties. For example, you could include IDX at the end of all index names.

- property_expression_list is either a single property name or a comma-separated list of properties, enclosed in parentheses.

- indextype is one of the following:

–

–

–

–

–

–

bitmap — a bitmap index

bitslice — a bitslice index

collatedkey — an index on the given property, using the collation of that property

columnar — a columnar index

index — a standard index (default)

key — deprecated

Details
This keyword specifies the type of the inde x, specifically whether the inde x is implemented as standard index or one of several special indexes.

A bitmap index cannot be marked as unique.

Default

If you omit this keyword, the index is a standard index.

- Unique (Index Keyword)

- Unique (Index Keyword) Specifies whether the index should enforce uniqueness.

Usage
To specify that InterSystems IRIS should enforce uniqueness for the properties on which this index is based, use the following
syntax:

Index name On property_expression_list [ Unique ];

Where:

- name is the name of the index. It is useful to follow a naming convention so that indexes can be easily distinguished from properties. For example, you could include IDX at the end of all index names.

- property_expression_list is either a single property name or a comma-separated list of properties, enclosed in parentheses.

Otherwise, omit this keyword or place the word Not immediately before the keyword.

Details
The Unique keyword, if present, indicates that this is a unique index.

The property (or properties) indexed by a unique index are constrained to have unique values (that is, no two instances can have the same collated value) within the extent (set of all objects) of the class (table) that defines the inde x.

A unique index cannot also be a bitmap index.

For a unique index, InterSystems IRIS generates methods that you can use to open objects, check existence of objects, and
delete objects; see Open, Exists, and Delete Methods.

Example

Class Member

Index SSNIdx On SSN [ Unique ] ;

Default

If you omit this keyword, InterSystems IRIS does not enforce uniqueness for the properties on which this index is based.

- Method Syntax and Keywords

- This reference describes the syntax and keywords that apply to a method.

- Method Syntax and Keywords Syntax of Methods in Class Definitions Describes the structure of a method definition.

Introduction
In most cases, a method definition defines the runtime beha generators, which are a special kind of method that generate the code that is used at runtime.

vior of the method. InterSystems IRIS supports also method

Details
A method definition has the follo wing structure:

/// description
Method name(formal_spec) As returnclass [ keyword_list ]
{ implementation }

Or (for a class method):

/// description
ClassMethod name(formal_spec) As returnclass [ keyword_list ]
{ implementation }

Or (for a client method):

/// description
ClientMethod name(formal_spec) As returnclass [ keyword_list ]
{ implementation }

Where:

- description (optional) is intended for display in the Class Reference. The description is blank by default. See Creating
Class Documentation.

- name (required) is the name of the method. This must be a valid class member name, and must not conflict with an y other class member names.

- formal_spec (optional) specifies the list of ar guments that are passed to or from the method.

- The formal specification is a list of a method’ s arguments, their types, their call-type (ByRef, Output, or ByVal), and optional default values. The Output call type is used to indicate arguments which are passed by reference, but whose incoming value is nominally not used.

- returnclass (optional) specifies the type of v alue returned by this method, if any. If you omit returnclass, also omit the word As keyword_list (optional) is a comma-separated list of keywords that further define the method.

See Method Syntax and Keywords for a complete keyword list.

If this list is omitted, also omit the square brackets.

- implementation (optional) is zero or more lines of code that define what the method does.

To specify the programming language used, use the class-level Language or method-level Language keyword.

Parameter Values

For formal_spec and returnclass, you can specify optional parameter values after the class names. If the method is used as an SQL stored procedure, then these parameter values are used to provide additional information to an ODBC or JDBC
client. These parameters are ignored in all other cases. For example:

Syntax of Methods in Class Definitions

Class Member

ClassMethod MyProc(data As %String(MAXLEN = 85)) As %Integer [ SQLProc ]
{
Quit 22
}

For another example:

Class Member

ClassMethod GetName() As %String(MAXLEN=222) [ SQLProc ]
{
Quit "Mo"
}

- Class Limits

- Method Syntax and Keywords

- Abstract (Method Keyword) Specifies whether this is an abstract method.

Usage
To specify that this method is abstract, use the following syntax:

Method name(formal_spec) As returnclass [ Abstract ] { //implementation }

Otherwise, omit this keyword or place the word Not immediately before the keyword.

Details
An abstract method has no implementation and has no executable code generated for it. Abstract methods exist solely for the purpose of defining a method signature (or interf ace) that can be overridden and implemented within one or more subclasses. Some examples of abstract methods are the various callback methods defined, b ut not implemented by, in the InterSystems IRIS class library.

Default

If you omit this keyword, the method is not abstract.

- ClientName (Method Keyword)

- ClientName (Method Keyword)

- Overrides the default name for the method in client projections.

Usage
To override the default name for this method when the class is projected to a client language, use the following syntax:

Method name(formal_spec) As returnclass [ ClientName = clientname ]
{ //implementation }

Where clientname is the name to use in the client language.

Details
This keyword lets you define an alternate name for a method when it is projected to a client language. This is especially useful if the method name contains characters that are not allowed in the client language.

Default

If you omit this keyword, the method name is used as the client name.

- Method Syntax and Keywords

- CodeMode (Method Keyword)

- Specifies ho w this method is implemented.

Usage
To specify how the method is implemented, use the following syntax:

Method name(formal_spec) As returnclass [ CodeMode=codemode ]
{ //implementation }

Where codemode is one of the following:

- call — this method is an alias for a routine call (used for wrapping legacy code).

- code (default) — this method is implemented as lines of code.

- expression — this method is implemented as an expression.

- objectgenerator — this method is a method generator.

Note:

There is an older value for this keyword (generator), which indicates that the older, non-object-based method generator should be used. This is only present for compatibility with older versions. Newer applications should use objectgenerator.

Details
This keyword specifies ho w a given method is implemented.

Typically, a method is implemented using one or more lines of code. This is indicated by the default CodeMode value of code. In this case, the method implementation is one or more lines of code.

Certain simple methods can be implemented as expression methods. In this case, the method implementation is a simple expression (with no Quit or Return statement).

A call method is a wrapper for a routine. In this case, the method implementation is the name of a routine and tag name.

Method generators are programs, invoked by the class compiler when a class is compiled, that generate the actual imple-
mentation for the given method. In this case, the method implementation is the code for the method generator.

Default

The default value for the CodeMode keyword is code. In the default case, you can omit the CodeMode keyword entirely.
For example:

Method name(formal_spec) As returnclass
{ //implementation }

Examples

/// An expression method
Method Double(val As %Integer) As %Integer [ CodeMode = expression ]
{
val * 2
}

/// A Method generator
Method GetClassName() As %String [ CodeMode = objectgenerator ]
{
Do %code.WriteLine(" Quit """ _ %class.Name _ """")
Quit $$$OK
}

CodeMode (Method Keyword)

- Method Syntax and Keywords

- Deprecated (Method Keyword)

- Specifies that this method is deprecated. This keyword is ignored by the class compiler and merely provides a humanreadable indicator that the method is deprecated.

Usage
To specify that this method is deprecated, use the following syntax:

Method name(formal_spec) As returnclass [ Deprecated ]
{ //implementation }

Otherwise, omit this keyword or place the word Not immediately before the keyword.

ExternalProcName (Method Keyword)

ExternalProcName (Method Keyword)

Specifies the name of this method when it is used as a stored procedure in a foreign database. Applies only if the method is projected as a stored procedure.

Usage
To override the default name of the method when it is used as a stored procedure in a foreign database, use the following
syntax:

ClassMethod name(formal_spec) As returnclass [ SqlProc, ExternalProcName = MyProcedure ]
{ //implementation }

Where MyProcedure is an unquoted string.

Details
This keyword lets you define the name to use for this method when it is used as a stored procedure in a foreign database.

Default

If you omit this keyword, the method name is used as the stored procedure name.

- SqlProc keyword

- Method Syntax and Keywords

- Final (Method Keyword)

- Specifies whether this method is final (cannot be o verridden in subclasses).

- Usage
To specify that a method is final, use the follo wing syntax:

Method name(formal_spec) As returnclass [ Final ]
{ //implementation }

Otherwise, omit this keyword or place the word Not immediately before the keyword.

Details
A class member that is marked as final cannot be overridden in subclasses.

Default

If you omit this keyword, the method is not final.

- ForceGenerate (Method Keyword)

- ForceGenerate (Method Keyword)

- Specifies whether the method should be compiled in every subclass. Applies only if the method is a method generator.

Usage
To specify that the method (a method generator) should be compiled in every subclass, use the following syntax:

Method name(formal_spec) As returnclass [ CodeMode = ObjectGenerator, ForceGenerate ]
{ //implementation }

Otherwise, omit this keyword or place the word Not immediately before the keyword.

Details
In the case of a method generator method, specifies that the method should be compiled in e very subclass. This keyword is useful when you need to ensure that each subclass has its version of the method. InterSystems IRIS does not recompile a method in a subclass if the generated code looks the same as the superclass generated code. This logic does not consider whether the include files are the same for both classes. If the method uses a macro that is defined in an include file and if the subclass uses a different include file, InterSystems IRIS w ould not recompile the method in the subclass. In such a scenario, specify ForceGenerate for the method generator.

Default

If you omit this keyword, the method is not compiled in every subclass.

- CodeMode keyword

- Method Syntax and Keywords

- GenerateAfter (Method Keyword)

- Specifies when to generate this method. Applies only if the method is a method generator.

Usage
To specify that the generator for this method should be invoked after other methods are generated, use the following syntax:

Method name(formal_spec) As returnclass [ CodeMode = ObjectGenerator, GenerateAfter = methodlist ]
{ //implementation }

Where methodlist is either a single method name or a comma-separated list of method names, enclosed in parentheses.

Details
In the case of a method generator method, specifies that the generator should be in voked after the listed methods are generated. This keyword is useful when you need to control the order in which your method generators are invoked.

- CodeMode keyword

- Internal (Method Keyword)

- Internal (Method Keyword)

- Specifies whether this method definition is internal (not displayed in the class documentation).

Usage
To specify that this method is internal, use the following syntax:

Method name(formal_spec) As returnclass [ Internal ]
{ //implementation }

Otherwise, omit this keyword or place the word Not immediately before the keyword.

Details
Internal class members are not displayed in the class documentation. This keyword is useful if you want users to see a class but not see all its members.

Default

If you omit this keyword, this method is displayed in the class documentation.

- Method Syntax and Keywords

- Language (Method Keyword)

- Specifies the language used to implement this method.

Usage
To specify the language used to implement the method, use the following syntax:

Method name(formal_spec) As returnclass [ Language = language ]
{ //implementation }

Where language is one of the following:

- objectscript (the default) — ObjectScript

- python — Embedded Python

- tsql — Transact-SQL

- ispl — Informix Stored Procedure Language

Details
This keyword specifies the language used to implement this method.

The values ispl and tsql are only supported for class methods.

If you specify a value of ispl, the body of the method is limited to a single CREATE PROCEDURE statement.

Default

If you omit this keyword, the language specified by the class-le vel Language keyword is used.

Note:

You cannot specify Language = ispl or Language = python at the class level; you can only use these
values for methods.

Note: Methods for sharded classes cannot be implemented using any language other than ObjectScript.

Examples

Class User.Person Extends %Persistent
{

Property Name As %String;

Property Gender As %String;

/// An ObjectScript instance method that writes the name and gender of a person
Method Write() [ Language = objectscript ]
{
write !, ..Name, " is a ", ..Gender, !
}

/// An Embedded Python instance method that prints the name and gender of a person
Method Print() [ Language = python ]
{
print('\n' + self.Name + ' is a ' + self.Gender)
}

/// A TSQL class method that inserts a row into the Person table
ClassMethod TSQLTest() [ Language = tsql ]
{
INSERT INTO Person (Name, Gender) VALUES ('Manon', 'Female')
}

/// An ISPL class method that creates a stored procedure named IsplSp
ClassMethod ISPLTest() [ Language = ispl ]
{

Language (Method Keyword)

CREATE PROCEDURE IsplSp()
INSERT INTO Person (Name, Gender) VALUES ('Nikolai', 'Male')
END PROCEDURE
}

}

- Method Syntax and Keywords

- NotInheritable (Method Keyword)

- Specifies whether this method can be inherited in subclasses.

Usage
To specify that this method cannot be inherited in subclasses, use the following syntax:

Method name(formal_spec) As returnclass [ NotInheritable ]
{ //implementation }

Otherwise, omit this keyword or place the word Not immediately before the keyword.

Details
This keyword specifies that this method cannot be inherited in subclasses.

Important: While having a member not be inheritable by its subclasses can be very useful in some cases, the keyword

should be used rarely and judiciously, as it breaks the inheritance contract.

Default

If you omit this keyword, this method is inheritable.

- PlaceAfter (Method Keyword)

- PlaceAfter (Method Keyword)

- Specifies the order of this method, relative to other methods, in the routine that is generated for the class.

Usage
To specify that the class compiler should place this method after the listed methods in the routine it creates for the class,
use the following syntax:

Method name(formal_spec) As returnclass [ PlaceAfter = methodlist ]
{ //implementation }

Where methodlist is either a single method name or a comma-separated list of method names, enclosed in parentheses.

Details
This keyword specifies that the class compiler should place this method after the listed methods in the routine it creates for the class. This keyword is for rare cases where you need to control the order in which the class compiler generates code for your method.

Default

If you omit this keyword, the class compiler uses its normal logic to determine the order of the methods in the routine that it generates.

- Method Syntax and Keywords

- Private (Method Keyword)

- Specifies whether this method is private (can be invoked only by methods of this class or its subclasses).

Usage
To specify that the method is private, use the following syntax:

Method name(formal_spec) As returnclass [ Private ]
{ //implementation }

Otherwise, omit this keyword or place the word Not immediately before the keyword.

Details
Private class members can be used only by other members of the same class (or its subclasses). Note that other languages often use the word protected to describe this kind of visibility and use the word private to mean invisibility from subclasses.

This keyword is inherited but you can change its value in subclasses.

Default
If you omit this keyword, this method is not private.

- ProcedureBlock (Method Keyword)

- ProcedureBlock (Method Keyword)

- Specifies whether this method is a procedure block. Applies only if the method is written in ObjectScript.

Usage
The class definition specifies whether methods in the class are procedure blocks by def
specify that a given method is a procedure block, use the following syntax:

ault. To override that default, and

Method name(formal_spec) As returnclass [ ProcedureBlock ]
{ //implementation }

Or (equivalently):

Method name(formal_spec) As returnclass [ ProcedureBlock=1 ]
{ //implementation }

Otherwise, to specify that a given method is not a procedure block, use the following syntax:

Method name(formal_spec) As returnclass [ ProcedureBlock=0 ]
{ //implementation }

Details
This keyword specifies that an ObjectScript method is a procedure block.

Within ObjectScript, methods can be implemented as procedure blocks or not. Procedure blocks enforce variable scoping:
methods cannot see variables defined by their caller . New applications use procedure blocks; non-procedure blocks exist
for backwards compatibility.

Default

If you omit this keyword, the value of the class-level ProcedureBlock keyword is used.

- Method Syntax and Keywords

- PublicList (Method Keyword)

- Specifies the public v ariables for this method. Applies only if the method is written in ObjectScript and is a procedure block.

Usage
To specify the list of public variables for the method, use the following syntax:

Method name(formal_spec) As returnclass [ PublicList = variablelist ]
{ //implementation }

Where publiclist is either a single variable name or a comma-separated list of variable names, enclosed in parentheses.

Details
This keyword is used only if method is written in ObjectScript and is a procedure block. In ObjectScript, the public list specifies a list of v ariables that are scoped as public variables. Public variables are visible to any methods invoked from the method defining the public list.

Default

If you omit this keyword, the method has no public variables.

Example

The following shows an example:

ClassMethod MyMethod(argA, argB) As %Status [ PublicList = (varname1, varname2, varname3)] {
// method implementation
}

- Variables

- Requires (Method Keyword)

- Requires (Method Keyword)

- Specifies a list of pri vileges a user or process must have to call this method.

Usage
To specify that this method should be restricted to users or processes that have the specified pri vileges, use the following
syntax:

Method name(formal_spec) As returnclass [ Requires = privilegelist ]
{ //implementation }

Where privilegelist is either a single privilege or a comma-separated list of privileges, enclosed in quotation marks. Each privilege takes the form resource:permission, where permission is Use, Read, or Write (or the single-letter abbreviations
U, R, or W). For example:

Requires="%DB_USER:R"

Requires="%DB_USER:READ"

To specify multiple permissions for one resource, concatenate the permissions (in either form) in any order. For example:

Requires="%DB_USER:RW"

Requires="%DB_USER:RWRITE"

Requires="%DB_USER:WR"

Requires="%DB_USER:WRITEREAD"

Details
The user or process must have all of the privileges in the list of privileges in order to call the method. Calling the method without the specified pri vileges results in a <PROTECT> error.

If a method inherits the Requires keyword from a superclass, you can add to the list of required privileges by setting a new value for the keyword. You cannot remove required privileges in this manner.

Default
If you omit this keyword, no special privileges are required to call this method.

Examples
The method below requires Read permission to the Sales database and Write permission to the Marketing database. (Note that if a database has Write permission, it automatically has Read permission.)

ClassMethod UpdateTotalSales() [ Requires = "%DB_SALES: Read, %DB_MARKETING: Write" ]
{
set newSales = ^["SALES"]Orders set totalSales = ^["MARKETING"]Orders set totalSales = totalSales + newSales set ^["MARKETING"]Orders = totalSales
}

Method Syntax and Keywords

To specify multiple permissions for one resource, use the single-letter abbreviations. The two methods below are functionally
equivalent:

ClassMethod TestMethod() [ Requires = "MyResource: RW" ]
{
write "You have permission to run this method"
}

ClassMethod TestMethodTwo() [ Requires = "MyResource: Read, MyResource: Write" ]
{
write "You have permission to run this method"
}

- Privileges and Permissions in Authorization Guide

- ReturnResultsets (Method Keyword)

- ReturnResultsets (Method Keyword) Specifies whether this method returns result sets (so that ODBC and JDBC clients can retrieve them).

Usage
To specify that the method returns at least one result set, use the following syntax:

ClassMethod name(formal_spec) As returnclass [ ReturnResultsets, SqlName = CustomSets, SqlProc ]
{ //implementation }

Otherwise, omit this keyword or place the word Not immediately before the keyword.

Details
This keyword specifies that the method returns at least one result set. Set this k eyword to true if the method might return one or more result sets. If you do not, then the result sets cannot be retrieved by database drivers, such as JDBC.

For a stored function, either specify Not ReturnResultsets or do not specify this keyword.

Default

If you omit this keyword, result sets cannot be retrieved by database drivers.

- Stored Functions

- Method Syntax and Keywords

- ServerOnly (Method Keyword)

- Specifies whether this method will be projected to a Java client.

- Usage
To override how InterSystems IRIS projects the method to a Java client, use the following syntax:

Method name(formal_spec) As returnclass [ ServerOnly=n ]
{ //implementation }

Where n is one of the following:

- 0 means that this method can be projected.

- 1 means that this method will not be projected.

Details
This keyword specifies that a method will not be projected to a Ja va client.

Tip

To see which methods of a class are server-only, use the following utility in the Terminal:

do dumpMethods^%occLGUtil("Sample.Person")

The argument is the fully qualified class name . This utility produces a report that indicates basic information about each method: whether the method is a stub, whether the method is server-only, and (if the method is derived from a property) the property from which it is derived.

Default

If you omit this keyword, this method will not be projected if it is a stub method (but will be projected if it is not a stub method).

- SoapAction (Method Keyword)

- SoapAction (Method Keyword)

- Specifies the SO AP action to use in the HTTP header when invoking this method as a web method via HTTP. Applies only in a class that is defined as a web service or web client.

Usage
To specify the SOAP action to use in the HTTP header when using this method as a web method, use the following syntax:

Method name(formal_spec) As returnclass [ WebMethod, SoapAction = soapaction ]
{ //implementation }

Where soapaction is one of the following:

- "[ default ]" — This causes InterSystems IRIS to use the default value for the SOAP action, which is
NAMESPACE/Package.Class.Method

- "customValue" — This causes InterSystems IRIS to use customValue as the SOAP action. The value should be a URI that identifies the intent of the SO AP request.

If you specify a custom value, either it must be unique within for each web method in the web service or you must specify the SoapRequestMessage keyword for each web method (and use unique values for that keyword).

- "" — This causes InterSystems IRIS to use an empty value as the SOAP action. This scenario is rare.

Details
The SOAP action for a web method is generally used to route the request SOAP message. For example, a fire wall could use it to appropriately filter SO AP request messages. An InterSystems IRIS web service service uses the SOAP action, in combination with the message itself, to determine how to process the request message.

This keyword lets you specify the HTTP SOAP action to use when invoking this method as a web method. For SOAP 1.1, the SOAP action is included as the SOAPAction HTTP header. For SOAP 1.2, it is included within the Content-Type HTTP header.

Default

If you omit the SoapAction keyword, the SOAP action is formed as follows:

NAMESPACE/Package.Class.Method

Where NAMESPACE is the value of the NAMESPACE parameter for the web service, Package.Class is the name of the web service class, and Method is the name of the web method.

The SoapAction keyword affects the <binding> section of the WSDL for the web service. For example, consider the
following web method:

Class Member

Method Add(a as %Numeric,b as %Numeric) As %Numeric [ SoapAction = MySoapAction,WebMethod ]
{
Quit a + b
}

For this web service, the <binding> section of the WSDL is as follows:

Method Syntax and Keywords

XML

<binding name="MyServiceNameSoap" type="s0:MyServiceNameSoap"> <soap:binding transport="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/http" style="document"/> <operation name="Add"> <soap:operation soapAction="MySoapAction" style="document"/> <input> <soap:body use="literal"/> </input> <output> <soap:body use="literal"/> </output> </operation> </binding>

By default, if the method did not specify the SoapAction keyword, the <soap:operation> element might instead be
like the following:

XML

<soap:operation soapAction="http://www.mynamespace.org/ROBJDemo.BasicWS.Add" style="document"/>

If you generate an InterSystems IRIS web service or client from a WSDL, InterSystems IRIS sets this keyword as appropriate for that WSDL.

Effect on the Message

For the web method shown previously, the web service expects a request message of the following form (for SOAP 1.1):

POST /csp/gsop/ROBJDemo.BasicWS.cls HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; InterSystems IRIS;)
Host: localhost:8080
Connection: Close
Accept-Encoding: gzip
SOAPAction: MySoapAction
Content-Length: 379
Content-Type: text/xml; charset=UTF-8

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<SOAP-ENV:Envelope >...

By default, if the method did not specify the SoapAction keyword, the SOAPAction line might instead be like the following:

SOAPAction: http://www.mynamespace.org/ROBJDemo.BasicWS.Add

Note that for SOAP 1.2, the details are slightly different. In this case, the web service expects a request message of the
following form:

POST /csp/gsop/ROBJDemo.BasicWS.cls HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; InterSystems IRIS;)
Host: localhost:8080
Connection: Close
Accept-Encoding: gzip Content-Length: 377
Content-Type: application/soap+xml; charset=UTF-8; action="MySoapAction"

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<SOAP-ENV:Envelope >...

- SoapBindingStyle (Method Keyword)

- SoapBindingStyle (Method Keyword)

- Specifies the binding style or SO AP invocation mechanism used by this method, when it is used as a web method. Applies only in a class that is defined as a web service or web client.

- Usage
To override the default binding style used by the method (when it is used as a web method), use the following syntax:

Method name(formal_spec) As returnclass [ WebMethod, SoapBindingStyle = soapbindingstyle ]
{ //implementation }

Where soapbindingstyle is one of the following:

- document (default) — This web method uses document-style invocation.

With this binding style, the SOAP messages are formatted as documents and typically have only one part.

In the SOAP messages, the <Body> element typically contains a single child element. Each child of the <Body> element corresponds to a message part.

- rpc — This web method uses RPC (remote procedure call)-style invocation.

With this binding style, the SOAP messages are formatted as messages with multiple parts.

In the SOAP messages, the <Body> element contains a single child element whose name is taken from the corresponding operation name. This element is a generated wrapper element, and it contains one child element for each argument in the argument list of the method.

Important:

For a web service that you create manually, the default value of this keyword is usually suitable. When you generate a web client or service from a WSDL, InterSystems IRIS sets this keyword as appropriate
for that WSDL; if you modify the value, your web client or service may no longer work.

Details
This keyword lets you specify the binding style used by a web method. It affects the format of the SOAP body (but not any SOAP headers).

For a given method, this keyword overrides the SoapBindingStyle class keyword.

Default

If you omit this keyword, the style attribute of <soap:operation> element is determined instead by the value for the SoapBindingStyle class keyword instead.

The SoapBindingStyle method keyword specifies the v alue of the style attribute of <soap:operation> element within the <binding> section of the WSDL. For example, if the SoapBindingStyle method keyword is document, the WSDL
could look as follows:

... <binding ...> ... <operation ...> <soap:operation ... style="document"/> ...

Method Syntax and Keywords

In contrast, if SoapBindingStyle is rpc, the WSDL could instead be as follows:

... <binding ...> ... <operation ...> <soap:operation ... style="rpc"/> ...

The binding style also affects the request and response <message> elements for the web method, as follows:

- If the binding style is document, each message has only one part by default. For example:

<message name="AddSoapIn"> <part name="parameters" .../> </message>

If the ARGUMENTSTYLE parameter is message, then a message can have multiple parts. For example:

<message name="AddSoapIn"> <part name="a" .../> <part name="b" .../> </message>

- If the binding style is rpc, a message can have multiple parts. For example:

<message name="AddSoapIn"> <part name="a" .../> <part name="b" .../> </message>

For information, see the entry for the SoapBindingStyle class keyword.

If you use this keyword with a method that uses an object of type %XML.DataSet as input or output, some limitations apply. See the entry for the SoapBindingStyle class keyword.

- SoapBodyUse (Method Keyword)

- SoapBodyUse (Method Keyword)

- Specifies the encoding used by the inputs and outputs of this method, when it is used as a web method. Applies only in a class that is defined as a web service or web client.

- Usage
To override the default encoding used by the inputs and outputs of the method (when it is used as a web method), use the
following syntax:

Method name(formal_spec) As returnclass [ WebMethod, SoapBodyUse = soapbodyuse ]
{ //implementation }

Where soapbodyuse is one of the following:

- literal (default) — This web method uses literal data. That is, the XML within the <Body> of the SOAP message exactly matches the schema given in the WSDL.

- encoded — This web method uses SOAP-encoded data. That is, the XML within the <Body> of the SOAP message
uses SOAP encoding as appropriate for the SOAP version being used, as required by the following specifications:

–

–

SOAP 1.1 (https://www.w3.org/TR/2000/NOTE-SOAP-20000508/)

SOAP 1.2 (https://www.w3.org/TR/soap12-part2/)

Important:

For a web service that you create manually, the default value of this keyword is usually suitable. When you generate a web client or service from a WSDL, InterSystems IRIS sets this keyword as appropriate
for that WSDL; if you modify the value, your web client or service may no longer work.

Details
This keyword specifies the encoding for the inputs and outputs of a web method.

For a given web method, this keyword overrides the SoapBodyUse class keyword.

Default

If you omit this keyword, the value for the SoapBodyUse class keyword is used instead.

For information, see the entry for the SoapBodyUse class keyword.

If you use this keyword with a method that uses an object of type %XML.DataSet as input or output, some limitations apply. See the entry for the SoapBindingStyle class keyword.

- Method Syntax and Keywords

- SoapMessageName (Method Keyword)

- Specifies the name attrib ute of the <part> element of the response message for this web method. Applies only in a class that is defined as a web service or web client.

Usage
To override the default name of the <part> element of the response message, use the following syntax:

Method name(formal_spec) As returnclass [ WebMethod, SoapMessageName = MyResponse ]
{ //implementation }

Where soapmessagename is any identifier that is v alid in XML.

Details

Note:

This keyword has an effect only for a web method that uses SoapBindingStyle equal to document (which is the default).

This keyword specifies the name of the child element of the body of the response message.

Default

If you omit this keyword, the message name is the name of the web method with Response appended to the end.

The name of the web method is taken from the web method definition in the web service; this can be changed only by
renaming that method.

The SoapMessageName keyword affects the <messages> and <types> sections of the WSDL for the web service. For
example, consider the following web method:

Class Member

Method Add(a as %Numeric,b as %Numeric) As %Numeric [ SoapMessageName=MyResponseMessage,WebMethod ]
{
Quit a + b
}

For this web service, the <types> and <messages> sections of the WSDL are as follows:

<types> <s:schema elementFormDefault="qualified" targetNamespace="http://www.mynamespace.org"> <s:element name="Add"> <s:complexType> <s:sequence> <s:element minOccurs="0" name="a" type="s:decimal"/> <s:element minOccurs="0" name="b" type="s:decimal"/> </s:sequence> </s:complexType> </s:element> <s:element name="MyResponseMessage"> <s:complexType> <s:sequence> <s:element name="AddResult" type="s:decimal"/> </s:sequence> </s:complexType> </s:element> </s:schema> </types> <message name="AddSoapIn"> <part name="parameters" element="s0:Add"/> </message> <message name="AddSoapOut"> <part name="parameters" element="s0:MyResponseMessage"/> </message>

SoapMessageName (Method Keyword)

By default, if the method did not specify the SoapMessageName keyword, the AddSoapOut message would have included an element named AddResponse instead of MyResponseMessage.

Notice that the SoapMessageName does not affect the child element (for example, AddResult) of the response message.

If you generate a web service or client from a WSDL, InterSystems IRIS sets this keyword as appropriate for that WSDL.

The web service might send a response message like the following:

XML

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<SOAP-ENV:Body>
<MyResponseMessage xmlns="http://www.mynamespace.org">
<AddResult>42</AddResult>
</MyResponseMessage>
</SOAP-ENV:Body>

By default, if the method did not specify the SoapMessageName keyword, the <MyResponseMessage> element would have been <AddResponse> instead.

- Method Syntax and Keywords

- SoapNameSpace (Method Keyword)

- Specifies the XML namespace used by a web method. Applies only in a class that is defined as a web service or web client.

- Usage
To override the default XML namespace used by a method (when the method is used as a web method), use the following
syntax:

Method name(formal_spec) As returnclass [ SoapNameSpace = "soapnamespace", WebMethod ]
{ //implementation }

Where soapnamespace is a namespace URI. Note that if the URI includes a colon (:), the string must be quoted. That is,
you can use the following:

Method MyMethod() [ SoapNameSpace = "http://www.mynamespace.org", WebMethod ]

Or the following:

Method MyMethod() [ SoapNameSpace = othervalue, WebMethod ]

But not the following:

Method MyMethod() [ SoapNameSpace = http://www.mynamespace.org, WebMethod ]

Important:

For a web service that you create manually, the default value of this keyword is usually suitable. When you generate a web client or service from a WSDL, InterSystems IRIS sets this keyword as appropriate
for that WSDL; if you modify the value, your web client or service may no longer work.

Details
This keyword specifies the XML namespace used by this web method. F or details, see Creating Web Services and Web
Clients.

Note:

This keyword has an effect only if the method uses RPC-style binding. That is, the method (or the class that contains it) must be marked with SoapBindingStyle equal to rpc. (If you specify this keyword for a method that uses document-style binding, the WSDL will not be self-consistent.)

Default

If you omit this keyword, the method is in the namespace specified by the NAMESPACE parameter of the web service or client class.

For an InterSystems IRIS web service service, the SoapNameSpace keyword affects the namespace declarations within the <definitions> element. The namespace that you specify (for example, http://www.customtypes.org) is added
here. For example:

... xmlns:ns2="http://www.customtypes.org" xmlns:s0="http://www.wsns.org" ... targetNamespace="http://www.wsns.org"

The http://www.customtypes.org namespace is assigned to the prefix ns2 in this example.

Notice that the WSDL also declares, as usual, the namespace of the web service (http://www.wsns.org). This namespace is assigned to the prefix s0 in this example and is also used as the target namespace.

SoapNameSpace (Method Keyword)

A possible SOAP message might look as follows (with line breaks and spaces added for readability):

XML

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?> <SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV='http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/' xmlns:xsi='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance' xmlns:s='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema' xmlns:SOAP-ENC='http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/' xmlns:tns='http://www.customtypes.org' > <SOAP-ENV:Body SOAP-ENV:encodingStyle='http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/'> <tns:AddResponse>
<AddResult>42</AddResult>
</tns:AddResponse>
</SOAP-ENV:Body>
</SOAP-ENV:Envelope>

Notice that the <AddResponse> element is in the http://www.webservicetypesns.org namespace.

In contrast, if we did not specify the SoapNameSpace keyword, the message would be as follows instead:

XML

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?> <SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV='http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/' xmlns:xsi='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance' xmlns:s='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema' xmlns:SOAP-ENC='http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/' xmlns:tns='http://www.wsns.org' > <SOAP-ENV:Body SOAP-ENV:encodingStyle='http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/'> <tns:AddResponse>
<AddResult>42</AddResult>
</tns:AddResponse>
</SOAP-ENV:Body>
</SOAP-ENV:Envelope>

In this case, the <AddResponse> element is in the namespace http://www.wsns.org, the namespace of the web service.

- Method Syntax and Keywords

- SoapRequestMessage (Method Keyword)

- Use this when multiple web methods have the same SoapAction. This keyword specifies the name of the top element in the SOAP body of the request message, in the default scenario. Applies only in a class that is defined as a web service or web client.

- Usage
To specify the name of the top element in the SOAP body of the request message, use the following syntax:

Method name(formal_spec) As returnclass [ WebMethod, SoapAction = "MyAct",
SoapRequestMessage="MyReqMessage" ]
{ //implementation }

Where soaprequestmessage is a valid XML identifier .

Details

Note:

This keyword has an effect only for wrapped document/literal messages.

This keyword specifies the name of the top element in the SO AP body of the request message, for wrapped document/literal messages. (Wrapped document/literal messages are the default. For information, see Examples of SOAP Message Variations.)

Specify this keyword if you use the same value for SoapAction for multiple web methods in the same web service. Otherwise, this keyword is not generally needed.

The SoapRequestMessage keyword affects the <message> sections of the WSDL for the web service. For example, consider
the following web method:

Class Member

Method Add(a as %Numeric,b as %Numeric) As %Numeric [ SoapAction = MyAct,SoapRequestMessage=MyReqMessage,
{
Quit a + b
}

For this web service, the WSDL includes the following:

<message name="AddSoapIn"> <part name="parameters" element="s0:MyReqMessage"/> </message> <message name="AddSoapOut"> <part name="parameters" element="s0:AddResponse"/> </message>

These elements are correspondingly defined in the <types> section.

By default, if the method did not specify the SoapRequestMessage keyword, the <message> sections would instead be
like the following:

<message name="AddSoapIn"> <part name="parameters" element="s0:Add"/> </message> <message name="AddSoapOut"> <part name="parameters" element="s0:AddResponse"/> </message>

If you generate an InterSystems IRIS web service or client from a WSDL, InterSystems IRIS sets this keyword as appropriate for that WSDL.

SoapRequestMessage (Method Keyword)

Effect on the Message

For the web method shown previously, the web service expects a request message of the following form:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?> <SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV='http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/' xmlns:xsi='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance' xmlns:s='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema'>
<SOAP-ENV:Body>
<MyReqMessage xmlns="http://www.myapp.org"><a>1</a><b>2</b></MyReqMessage>
</SOAP-ENV:Body>
</SOAP-ENV:Envelope>

In contrast, if the method did not specify the SoapRequestMessage keyword, the message would instead be like the following:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?> <SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV='http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/' xmlns:xsi='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance' xmlns:s='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema'>
<SOAP-ENV:Body>
<Add xmlns="http://www.myapp.org"><a>1</a><b>2</b></Add>
</SOAP-ENV:Body>
</SOAP-ENV:Envelope>

- Method Syntax and Keywords

- SoapTypeNameSpace (Method Keyword)

- Specifies the XML namespace for the types used by this web method. Applies only in a class that is defined as a web service or web client.

- Usage
To override the default XML namespace for the types (when the method is used as a web method), use the following syntax:

Method name(formal_spec) As returnclass [ SoapTypeNameSpace = "soapnamespace", SoapBindingStyle =
document, WebMethod ]
{ //implementation }

Where soapnamespace is a namespace URI. Note that if the URI includes a colon (:), the string must be quoted. That is,
you can use the following:

Method MyMethod() [ SoapTypeNameSpace = "http://www.mynamespace.org", SoapBindingStyle = document,

Or the following:

Method MyMethod() [ SoapTypeNameSpace = othervalue, SoapBindingStyle = document, WebMethod ]

But not the following:

Method MyMethod() [ SoapTypeNameSpace = http://www.mynamespace.org, SoapBindingStyle = document,

Important:

For a web service that you create manually, the default value of this keyword is usually suitable. When you generate a web client or a service from a WSDL, InterSystems IRIS sets this keyword as appropriate
for that WSDL; if you modify the value, your web client or service may no longer work.

Details
This keyword specifies the XML namespace for the types used by this web method. F or details, see Creating Web Services and Web Clients.

Note:

This keyword has an effect only if the method uses document-style binding. That is, the method (or the class that contains it) must be marked with SoapBindingStyle equal to document. (It is meaningless to specify this keyword for a method that uses rpc-style binding.)

Default

If you omit this keyword, the types for this method are in the namespace specified by the TYPENAMESPACE parameter of the web service or client class. If TYPENAMESPACE is not specified, the types are instead in the namespace specified by the NAMESPACE parameter of the web service or client.

The SoapTypeNameSpace keyword affects the following parts of the WSDL:

- The namespace declarations within the <definitions> element. The namespace that you specify (for example,
http://www.customtypes.org) is added here. For example:

... xmlns:ns2="http://www.customtypes.org" xmlns:s0="http://www.wbns.org" xmlns:s1="http://webservicetypesns.org" ... targetNamespace="http://www.wbns.org"

SoapTypeNameSpace (Method Keyword)

The http://www.customtypes.org namespace is assigned to the prefix ns2 in this example.

Notice that the WSDL also declares the following namespaces as usual:

–

–

The namespace of the Web service (http://www.wsns.org), which is assigned to the prefix s0 in this example and which is also used as the target namespace for the Web service.

The types namespace of the Web service (http://www.webservicetypesns.org), which is assigned to the prefix s1 in this example.

If no types namespace is specified in the web service class, this namespace is not included in the WSDL.

- The <types> element, which includes a <schema> element whose targetNamespace attribute equals the
namespace you specified for SoapT ypeNameSpace:

<types> ... <s:schema elementFormDefault="qualified" targetNamespace="http://www.customtypes.org"> <s:element name="Add"> <s:complexType> <s:sequence> <s:element minOccurs="0" name="a" type="s:decimal"/> <s:element minOccurs="0" name="b" type="s:decimal"/> </s:sequence> </s:complexType> </s:element> <s:element name="AddResponse"> <s:complexType> <s:sequence> <s:element name="AddResult" type="s:decimal"/> </s:sequence> </s:complexType> </s:element> </s:schema>

... </types>

In contrast, if you did not specify SoapTypeNameSpace, this part of the WSDL would be as follows instead. Notice
that the targetNamespace for the <schema> element is the namespace of the types for the web service:

<types> ... <s:schema elementFormDefault="qualified" targetNamespace="http://www.webservicetypesns.org"> <s:element name="Add"> <s:complexType> <s:sequence> <s:element minOccurs="0" name="a" type="s:decimal"/> <s:element minOccurs="0" name="b" type="s:decimal"/> </s:sequence> </s:complexType> </s:element> <s:element name="AddResponse"> <s:complexType> <s:sequence> <s:element name="AddResult" type="s:decimal"/> </s:sequence> </s:complexType> </s:element> </s:schema>

... </types>

(Also, if no types namespace is specified in the web service class, the targetNamespace would instead be the namespace of the web service.)

Effect on Messages

- SqlName (Method Keyword)

- SqlName (Method Keyword)

- Overrides the default name of the projected SQL stored procedure. Applies only if this method is projected as an SQL stored procedure.

- Usage
To override the default name used when the method is projected as an SQL stored procedure, use the following syntax:

ClassMethod name(formal_spec) As returnclass [ SqlProc, SqlName = sqlname ]
{ //implementation }

Where sqlname is an SQL identifier .

Details
If this method is projected as an SQL stored procedure, then this name is used as the name of the stored procedure.

Default

If you omit this keyword, InterSystems IRIS determines the SQL name as follows:

CLASSNAME_METHODNAME

This default uses uppercase letters. You can use any case when you invoke the stored procedure, however, because SQL is case-insensitive.

Thus, in the following example, the default SQL name value is TEST1_PROC1. This default value is specified in the
SELECT statement:

Class Definition

Class User.Test1 Extends %Persistent
{
ClassMethod Proc1(BO,SUM) As %INTEGER [ SqlProc ]
{
///definition not shown
}

Query Q1(KD As %String,P1 As %String,P2 As %String) As %SqlQuery
{
SELECT SUM(SQLUser.TEST1_PROC1(1,2)) AS Sumd
FROM SQLUser.Test1
}
}

- SqlProc keyword

- Method Syntax and Keywords

- SqlProc (Method Keyword)

- Specifies whether the method can be invoked as an SQL stored procedure. Only class methods (not instance methods) can be called as SQL stored procedures.

- Usage
To specify that the method can be invoked as an SQL stored procedure, use the following syntax:

ClassMethod name(formal_spec) As returnclass [ SqlProc ]
{ //implementation }

Otherwise, omit this keyword or place the word Not immediately before the keyword.

Details
This keyword specifies that the method can be in voked as an SQL stored procedure. Only class methods (not instance methods) can be called as SQL stored procedures.

Stored procedures are inherited by subclasses.

Default

If you omit this keyword, the method is not available as an SQL stored procedure.

- WebMethod (Method Keyword)

- Specifies whether this method is a web method. Applies only in a class that is defined as a web service or web client.

- WebMethod (Method Keyword)

- Usage
To specify that this method is a web method, use the following syntax:

Method name(formal_spec) As returnclass [ WebMethod ]
{ //implementation }

Otherwise, omit this keyword or place the word Not immediately before the keyword.

Details
This keyword specifies that this method is a vailable as a web method and can be invoked via the SOAP protocol.

Important:

In most cases, web methods should be instance methods, rather than class methods. For details and for other requirements for a web method, see Creating Web Services and Web Clients.

Default

If you omit this keyword, the method is not available as a web method.

Generated Class

When you add this keyword to a method and compile the class, the class compiler generates an additional class:
Package.OriginalClass.MethodName, where Package.OriginalClass is the class that contains the web method, and MethodName is the name of web method.

For example, suppose that you start with the class ROBJDemo.DocLiteralWS and you add a method to it named Add. When you add the WebMethod keyword to that method and compile, the class compiler generates the class
ROBJDemo.DocLiteralWS.Add.

Do not modify or directly use this generated class; it is intended only for internal use.

For a web service, this keyword also affects the generated WSDL, which now contains the additional elements needed to represent this web method.

- This reference describes the syntax and keywords that apply to a class parameter.

- Syntax of Parameters in Class Definitions

- Describes the structure of a parameter definition.

- Introduction
A parameter definition defines a constant v (or at any point before compilation), you can set the values for its class parameters. By default, the value of each parameter is the null string, but you can specify a non-null value as part of the parameter definition. At compile-time, the value of the parameter is established for all instances of a class. With rare exceptions, this value cannot be altered at runtime.

alue available to all objects of a given class. When you create a class definition

Details
A parameter definition has the follo wing structure:

/// description
Parameter name As parameter_type [ keyword_list ] = value ;

Where:

- description (optional) is intended for display in the Class Reference. The description is blank by default. See Creating
Class Documentation.

- name (required) is the name of the parameter. This must be a valid class member name, and must not conflict with an y other class member names.

- parameter_type (optional) specifies the user interf ace type of the parameter and can be used by IDEs to provide input validation for the parameter.

- This is not a class name; see the next section. In most cases, the compiler ignores this keyword.

- If you omit parameter_type, also omit the word As value (optional) specifies the v alue of the parameter. If you omit value, also omit the equals sign = keyword_list (optional) is a comma-separated list of keywords that further define the parameter .

See Parameter Syntax and Keywords for a complete keyword list.

If this list is omitted, also omit the square brackets.

Allowed Types for Parameters
The parameter_type option can be one of the following values:

- BOOLEAN — A true (1) or false (0) value.

- CLASSNAME — A valid class name.

- COSCODE — ObjectScript code.

- COSEXPRESSION — A valid ObjectScript expression.

- If a parameter is of type COSEXPRESSION, the expression is evaluated at runtime.

- Unlike most other values of the parameter Type keyword, this value affects the compiler.

- COSIDENTIFIER — A valid ObjectScript identifier .

- INTEGER — An integer value.

SQL — An SQL statement.

SQLIDENTIFIER — A valid SQL identifier .

Syntax of Parameters in Class Definitions

- STRING — A string value.

- TEXT — A multi-line text value.

- CONFIGVALUE — A parameter that can be modified outside of the class definition. Unlik parameter Type keyword, this value affects the compiler. If a parameter is of type CONFIGVALUE, then you can
modify the parameter via the $SYSTEM.OBJ.UpdateConfigP aram(). For example, the following changes the value
of the parameter MYPARAM (in the class MyApp.MyClass so that its new value is 42:

e most other values of the

set sc=$system.OBJ.UpdateConfigParam("MyApp.MyClass","MYPARAM",42)

Note that $SYSTEM.OBJ.UpdateConfigP aram() affects the generated class descriptor as used by any new processes,
but does not affect the class definition. If you recompile the class, InterSystems IRIS re generates the class descriptor, which will now use the value of this parameter as contained in the class definition (thus o verwriting the change made
via $SYSTEM.OBJ.UpdateConfigP aram()).

You also can omit parameter_type.

Example

/// This is the name of our web service.
Parameter SERVICENAME = "SOAPDemo" ;

- Defining and Referring to Class P arameters

- Class Limits Abstract (Parameter Keyword) Specifies whether this is an abstract parameter.

Usage
To specify that this parameter is abstract, use the following syntax:

Parameter name As parameter_type [ Abstract ] = value ;

Otherwise, omit this keyword or place the word Not immediately before the keyword.

Details
An abstract parameter simply behaves as if it were not defined. Ho wever, users can define an abstract parameter for documentation purposes and in order to enforce the signature of this parameter to be defined in the subclasses.

Default

If you omit this keyword, the parameter is not abstract.

- Defining and Referring to Class P arameters

- Constraint (Parameter Keyword)

- Constraint (Parameter Keyword) Specifies a user interf ace constraint in IDEs for this parameter.

Usage
To specify a user interface constraint for this parameter, use the following syntax:

Parameter name As parameter_type [ Constraint = "constraint" ] = value ;

Where constraint is a string used by the IDE.

Details
The constraint value can be used by IDEs to provide input validation for the parameter. Its value is not used nor enforced by the class compiler.

This keyword works in conjunction with the Flags keyword. For example, if Flags is set to ENUM, then Constraint should be a comma-separated list of possible parameter values.

Example

Parameter MYPARAM [ Constraint = "X,Y,Z", Flags = ENUM ] = "X";

- Defining and Referring to Class P arameters

- Deprecated (Parameter Keyword)

- Specifies that this parameter is deprecated. This keyword is ignored by the class compiler and merely provides a humanreadable indicator that the parameter is deprecated.

Usage
To specify that this parameter is deprecated, use the following syntax:

Parameter name As parameter_type [ Deprecated ] = value;

Otherwise, omit this keyword or place the word Not immediately before the keyword.

- Final (Parameter Keyword) Final (Parameter Keyword) Specifies whether this parameter is final (cannot be o verridden in subclasses)

Usage
To specify that a parameter is final, use the follo wing syntax:

Parameter name As parameter_type [ Final ] = value;

Otherwise, omit this keyword or place the word Not immediately before the keyword.

Details
A class member that is marked as final cannot be overridden in subclasses.

Default

If you omit this keyword, the parameter is not final.

- Defining and Referring to Class P arameters

- Flags (Parameter Keyword)

- Modifies the user interf ace type (in IDEs) for this parameter.

Usage
To modify the user interface type (in IDEs) for this parameter, use the following syntax:

Parameter name As parameter_type [ Flags = flags ] = value;

Where fla gs is one of the following:

- ENUM — The parameter is one of the values specified by the Constraint keyword (a comma-separated list).

- LIST — The parameter value is a string consisting of a comma-separated list of items.

Note that EDIT, EMPTY, and SYS are not used.

Details
Modifies the user interf ace type (in IDEs) for the parameter. The class compiler ignores this keyword.

- Defining and Referring to Class P arameters

- Internal (Parameter Keyword)

- Internal (Parameter Keyword) Specifies whether this parameter definition is internal (not displayed in the class documentation).

Usage
To specify that this parameter is internal, use the following syntax:

Parameter name As parameter_type [ Internal ] = value;

Otherwise, omit this keyword or place the word Not immediately before the keyword.

Details
Internal class members are not displayed in the class documentation. This keyword is useful if you want users to see a class but not see all its members.

Default

If you omit this keyword, this parameter is displayed in the class documentation.

- Syntax of Projections in Class Definitions Describes the structure of a projection definition.

Introduction
A projection definition instructs the class compiler to perform specified operations when a class definition is compiled or removed. A projection defines the name of a projection class (deri ved from the %Projection.AbstractProjection class) that implements methods that are called when the compilation of a class is complete and when a class definition is remo ved (either because it is being deleted or because the class is about to be recompiled).

Details
A projection definition has the follo wing structure:

/// description
Projection name As projection_class (parameter_list) ;

Where:

- description (optional) is intended for display in the Class Reference (but note that projections are not currently shown in the Class Reference). The description is blank by default. See Creating Class Documentation.

- name (required) is the name of the projection. This must be a valid class member name, and must not conflict with an y other class member names.

- projection_class (required) is the name of the projection class, which is a subclass of %Projection.AbstractProjection.

- parameter_list (optional) is a comma-separated list of parameters and their values. If specified, these should be parameters used by projection_class.

- If this list is omitted, also omit the parentheses.

keyword_list (optional) is a comma-separated list of keywords that further define the projection.

See Projection Syntax and Keywords for a complete keyword list.

If this list is omitted, also omit the square brackets.

- Class Limits

- Internal (Projection Keyword) Specifies whether this projection definition is internal (not displayed in the class documentation). Note that the class documentation does not currently display projections at all.

Internal (Projection Keyword)

Usage
To specify that this projection is internal, use the following syntax:

Projection projectionname As class [ Internal ];

Otherwise, omit this keyword or place the word Not immediately before the keyword.

Details
Internal class members are not displayed in the class documentation. This keyword is useful if you want users to see a class but not see all its members.

Note that the class documentation does not currently display projections at all.

Default

If you omit this keyword, the projection is not internal.

- Property Syntax and Keywords

- This reference describes the syntax and keywords that apply to a property, which you can define in object classes.

Property Syntax and Keywords

Syntax of Properties in Class Definitions

Describes the structure of a property definition. Note that a relationship is a property .

Introduction
A property contains information relevant to an instance of a class. You can add property definitions to object classes. They are not meaningful in other kinds of classes.

Details
A property definition has the follo wing structure:

/// description
Property name As classname (parameter_list) [ keyword_list ] ;

Or (for a list property):

/// description
Property name As List Of classname (parameter_list) [ keyword_list ] ;

Or (for an array property):

/// description
Property name As Array Of classname (parameter_list) [ keyword_list ] ;

Or (for a relationship property):

/// description
Relationship name As classname [ keyword_list ] ;

Where:

- description (optional) is intended for display in the Class Reference. The description is blank by default. See Creating
Class Documentation.

- name (required) is the name of the property. This must be a valid class member name, and must not conflict with an y other class member names.

- classname (optional) is the name of the class on which this property is based.

- parameter_list (optional) is a comma-separated list of parameters and their values. If specified, these should be either parameters used by classname or parameters that are available to all properties.

- If this list is omitted, also omit the parentheses.

keyword_list (required for a relationship property but otherwise optional ) is a comma-separated list of keywords that further define the property .

See Property Syntax and Keywords for a complete keyword list.

If this list is omitted, also omit the square brackets.

Note:

Relationships are not supported for sharded classes.

Example

/// Person's Social Security number.
Property SSN As %String(PATTERN = "3N1""-""2N1""-""4N") [ Required ];

Syntax of Properties in Class Definitions

- Class Limits

- Property Syntax and Keywords

- Aliases (Property Keyword)

- Specifies additional names for this property for use via object access.

Usage
To specify additional names for the property, use the following syntax:

Property name As classname [ Aliases=othernames ];

Where othernames is a comma-separated list of valid property names, enclosed in curly braces.

Details
If you specify the Aliases keyword, the compiler creates the given alias or aliases, which point to the same underlying data
that the original property points to. For example, suppose we redefine the Name property of Sample.Person as follows:

Property Name As %String(POPSPEC = "Name()") [ Aliases = {Alternate}, Required ];

Then your code can then work with either the Name property or the equivalent Alternate property, as shown in the following
Terminal session:

SAMPLES>set p=##class(Sample.Person).%OpenId(1)

SAMPLES>w p.Name
Fripp,Charles Z.
SAMPLES>w p.Alternate
Fripp,Charles Z.
SAMPLES>set p.Alternate="Anderson,Neville J."

SAMPLES>w p.Name
Anderson,Neville J.

Any property methods associated with the original property are also defined for each alias property , so in this example AlternateIsValid() is callable and returns the same result as NameIsValid() method does. Also if you override a property method (for example, writing a custom NameGet() method), then that override automatically applies to the alias property or properties.

Note:

This keyword has no effect on the SQL projection of the property.

Default

By default, this keyword is null and a property has no aliases.

Example

Property PropA As %String [ Aliases={OtherName,OtherName2} ];

- Calculated (Property Keyword)

- Calculated (Property Keyword)

- Specifies that this property has no in-memory storage allocated for it when the object containing it is instantiated.

- Usage
To specify that the property has no in-memory storage allocated for it, use the following syntax:

Property name As classname [ Calculated ];

Otherwise, omit this keyword or place the word Not immediately before the keyword.

Details
This keyword specifies that the property has no in-memory storage allocated for it when the object containing it is instantiated.

Use this keyword when you are defining a property that does not need an y in-memory storage. There are two ways to
specify a value for this property:

- Define a Get (and possibly a Set) method for the property. For example, for an Age property, you could provide an AgeGet method that determines a person’s current age based on the current time and the value of their DateOfBirth property. See Using and Overriding Property Methods.

- Define this property as a computed property; this uses the SqlComputed keyword and related keywords. See Defining
a Computed Property.

Subclasses inherit the Calculated keyword and cannot override it.

To include a property with the Calculated keyword in an index for a SQL table, you must also specify the SqlComputed and SqlComputeCode keywords as well. If you try to compile the class with an index on a Calculated property, without also specifying the SqlComputed and SqlComputeCode keywords on the property, the system returns the following error
message:

ERROR #5414: Invalid index attribute: <classname>::<indexname>::<propertyname> ERROR #5030: An error occurred while compiling class <classname>

Default

The default value for the Calculated keyword is false.

Example

Property Age as %Integer [ Calculated ];

- Property Syntax and Keywords

- Cardinality (Property Keyword)

- Specifies the cardinality of this relationship property. Required for relationship properties. Not used for other properties.

- Usage
To specify the cardinality of a relationship property, use the following syntax:

Relationship relname As classname [ Cardinality = cardinality; inverse = inverse ];

Where cardinality is one of the following:

- one

- many

- parent

- children

Details
This keyword specifies the cardinality of a relationship property .

The Cardinality keyword is required for relationship properties. It is ignored by non-relationship properties.

For more information on relationships, see Defining and Using Relationships

Default

There is no default. When you define a relationship, you must specify the Cardinality k eyword.

Example

Relationship Entries As Sample.CalendarEntry [ Cardinality = many; inverse = Sample.Calendar ];

- Inverse keyword

- ClientName (Property Keyword)

- ClientName (Property Keyword) Specifies an alias used by client projections of this property.

Usage
To override the default name for this property when the class is projected to a client language, use the following syntax:

Property name As classname [ ClientName = clientname ];

Where clientname is the name to use in the client language.

Details
This keyword lets you define an alternate name for a property when it is projected to a client language. This is especially useful if the property name contains characters that are not allowed in the client language.

Default

If you omit this keyword, the property name is used as the client name.

- Property Syntax and Keywords

- Collection (Property Keyword)

- Deprecated means of specifying the collection type of a collection property. Do not use.

- Details
This keyword has been replaced by the “As” syntax, described in Working with Collections.

- ComputeLocalOnly (Property Keyword) ComputeLocalOnly (Property Keyword) Controls whether a SqlComputed field is computed only on the local serv er for federated and sharded tables.

Details
When the value is 1, the SqlComputeCode is only executed only on the server where the data exists. As a result, in a sharded or federated environment, computed data is only returned from the system that the query was issued from. The SqlComputeCode is not computed on the other shards.

When the value is 0, the SqlComputeCode can be executed on any server.

Default
The default is 0.

- SqlComputeCode

- SqlComputed

- Defining a Computed Property

Property Syntax and Keywords

Deferred (Property Keyword)

Specifies that a property is not filed automatically when a ne w record is inserted or updates, but is deferred until a backfilling operation can update it at a later time.

Usage
To specify that this property is deferred, use the following syntax:

Property name As classname [ Deferred ];

Otherwise, omit this keyword or place the word Not immediately before the keyword.

Details
A deferred property is not immediately filed when a ne w record is inserted or updated. Instead, the record is flagged as having deferred filing w ork to complete, which is accomplished by a backfilling operation at a later time.

When this keyword is specified on a computed field, queries that in rows that have not yet been filed by the backfilling operation. You should weigh the benefits that deferred filing bring to the efficienc y of your application against the risk of querying stale information.

volve the field may only see stale information and skip

Default

The default for the Deferred keyword is false.

Requirements

The table must have a bitmap-compatible ID.

For a property to be marked as Deferred, it must have SqlComputed=1, but cannot have either Calculated=1 or Transient=1.

Properties marked as Deferred cannot be Required, part of an enforced foreign key, or constrained by a VALUELIST. In short, no validation can be performed on Deferred fields.

A trigger cannot be marked as Deferred.

Deprecated (Property Keyword)

Specifies that this property is deprecated. This keyword is ignored by the class compiler and merely provides a humanreadable indicator that the property is deprecated.

Deprecated (Property Keyword)

Usage
To specify that this property is deprecated, use the following syntax:

Property name As classname [ Deprecated ];

Otherwise, omit this keyword or place the word Not immediately before the keyword.

Property Syntax and Keywords

Final (Property Keyword)

Specifies whether this property is final (cannot be o verridden in subclasses).

Usage
To specify that a property is final, use the follo wing syntax:

Property name As classname [ Final ];

Otherwise, omit this keyword or place the word Not immediately before the keyword.

Details
A class member that is marked as final cannot be overridden in subclasses.

Default

If you omit this keyword, the property is not final.

- Identity (Property Keyword)

- Identity (Property Keyword)

- Specifies whether this property corresponds to the identity column in the corresponding SQL table. Applies to persistent classes.

- Usage
To specify that this property corresponds to the identity column in the corresponding SQL table, use the following syntax:

Property name As %Integer [ Identity ];

Note:

The type of the property can be any integer type, for example, %BigInt, %Integer, %SmallInt, or %TinyInt.

Otherwise, omit this keyword or place the word Not immediately before the keyword.

Details
For a persistent object, this keyword specifies that a property corresponds to an identity column in the corresponding SQL table (that is, a column that is marked with the SQL IDENTITY keyword). This keyword is useful particularly for tables that are created through DDL statements. When creating a table using DDL, make sure that any IDENTITY field is defined with MINVAL=1, if possible, to allow the creation of a bitmap extent index. See CREATE TABLE.

Important:

If a property is tagged as the identity column, the value of this property cannot be edited after the object has been saved.

Default

If you omit this keyword, this property is not used as the identity column.

- Property Syntax and Keywords

- InitialExpression (Property Keyword) Specifies an initial v alue for this property.

Usage
To specify an initial value for this property, use the following syntax:

Property name As classname [ InitialExpression = initialexpression ];

Where initialexpression is a constant or an ObjectScript expression enclosed in curly braces.

Details
This keyword specifies an initial v alue for the property. This value is assigned by the %New() method of the class when a new instance is created. (If a property is transient, then its initial value is determined either by code invoked by %New() when the instance is created or by code invoked by %OpenId() when the instance is loaded from disk into memory.)

The value of the initial expression must be suitable for the given property type.

The expression can be arbitrarily complex, with the following limitations:

- The initial expression cannot refer to other properties. That is, an expression such as {..otherpropertyname} is
not valid.

- The initial expression cannot instantiate an object and cannot include an object reference.

- The initial expression cannot invoke an instance method (only class methods).

- The initial expression must be specified in ObjectScript.

- The code executed by the expression should not report errors. InterSystems IRIS does not provide a way to handle errors returned by the expression.

- If the code executed by the expression causes other processing to occur, InterSystems IRIS does not provide a way to handle results of that processing.

Subclasses inherit the value of the InitialExpression keyword and can override it.

Default

The default value for the InitialExpression keyword is null.

Examples

The following shows several examples that use ObjectScript expressions:

Property DateTime As %Date [ InitialExpression = {$zdateh("1966-10-28",3)} ];

Property MyString As %String [ InitialExpression = {$char(0)} ];

/// this one is initialized with the value of a parameter
Property MyProp As %String [ InitialExpression = {..#MYPARAM} ];

/// this one is initialized by a class method
Property MyProp2 As %Numeric [ InitialExpression = {..Initialize()} ];

- InitialExpression (Property Keyword)

- Property Syntax and Keywords

- Internal (Property Keyword)

- Specifies whether this property definition is internal (not displayed in the class documentation). .

Usage
To specify that this property is internal, use the following syntax:

Property propertyname As classname [ Internal ];

Otherwise, omit this keyword or place the word Not immediately before the keyword.

Details
Internal class members are not displayed in the class documentation. This keyword is useful if you want users to see a class but not see all its members.

Default

If you omit this keyword, this property is displayed in the class documentation.

- Inverse (Property Keyword)

- Inverse (Property Keyword)

- Specifies the in verse side of this relationship. Required for relationship properties. Not used for other properties.

- Usage
To specify the relationship property in the related class that is the inverse of this relationship property, use the following
syntax:

Relationship Entries As Sample.CalendarEntry [ Cardinality = cardinality; Inverse = inverse ];

Where inverse is the name of the property in the related class.

Details
This keyword specifies the name of the in verse side of a relationship — that is, the name of the corresponding relationship property in the related class. The inverse property must exist in the related class and have the correct Cardinality value.

The Inverse keyword is required for relationship properties. It is ignored by non-relationship properties.

For more information, see Defining and Using Relationships

Default

There is no default. When you define a relationship, you must specify the In verse keyword.

Example

Relationship Entries As Sample.CalendarEntry [ Cardinality = many; inverse = Sample.Calendar ];

- Cardinality keyword

- Property Syntax and Keywords

- MultiDimensional (Property Keyword) Specifies that this property has the characteristics of a multidimensional array.

Usage
To specify that this property has the characteristics of a multidimensional array, use the following syntax:

Property Data [ Multidimensional ];

Otherwise, omit this keyword or place the word Not immediately before the keyword.

Details
A multidimensional property is different from other properties as follows:

- InterSystems IRIS does not provide property methods for it (for information on property methods, see Defining and
Using Classes).

- It is ignored when the object is validated or saved.

- It is not saved to disk, unless your application includes code to save it specifically .

- That is, the property is also automatically Transient.

- It cannot be exposed to Java or other clients.

It cannot be stored in or exposed through SQL tables.

Multidimensional properties are rare but provide a useful way to temporarily contain information about the state of an object.

Default

If this keyword is omitted, the property is not multidimensional.

- OnDelete (Property Keyword)

- OnDelete (Property Keyword)

- Specifies the action to tak e in the current table when a related object is deleted. This keyword applies only to a relationship property that specifies Cardinality as Parent or One. Its use is invalid in all other contexts.

- Usage
To specify the action to take in the current table when a related object is deleted, use the following syntax:

Relationship relname As classname [ Cardinality = cardinality, Inverse = inverse, OnDelete = ondelete
];

Where ondelete is one of the following values. In this discussion, related record is a record or object belonging to the other side of the relationship, and referencing record is the record or object in this side of the relationship.

- cascade — When a related record is deleted, the referencing record in this table is also deleted.

- noaction — When an attempt is made to delete a related record, the attempt fails.

- setdefault — When a related record is deleted, the referencing record in this table is set to its default value.

- setnull — When a related record is deleted, the referencing record in this table is set to null.

Details
This keyword defines the referential action that occurs when a record is deleted on the other side of a relationship.

Default

If you omit this keyword, then:

- For a relationship with Cardinality as Parent, OnDelete is cascade. That is, when you delete the parent record, by default, the associated child records are deleted.

- For a relationship with Cardinality as One, OnDelete is noaction. That is, when you attempt to delete the one record, by default, the attempt fails if the other table has any records that point to it.

Example

Class MyApp.Employee Extends %Persistent {
...
Relationship Employer As MyApp.Company [ Cardinality = one, Inverse = Employees, OnDelete = cascade ];
}

This example shows a one-to-many relationship between a company and its employees. As shown here, the Cardinality signifies that compan y is the “one” side of the relationship, while OnDelete indicates the effect of deleting the company on its employees. As the value of OnDelete is cascade, when a company is deleted, its effect cascades and the employees are also deleted.

If the value of OnDelete is noaction (the default for one-to-many relationships), deleting a company is not permitted if any employee has the company as its employer.

If the value of OnDelete is setnull or setdefault, deleting a company sets the employer of any of its employees to null.

- Property Syntax and Keywords

- Private (Property Keyword) Specifies whether the property is private (can be used only by methods of this class or its subclasses).

Usage
To specify that the property is private, use the following syntax:

Property name As classname [ Private ];

Otherwise, omit this keyword or place the word Not immediately before the keyword.

Details
A private class member can only be used by methods of this class (or its subclasses).

A private property is not displayed in the catalog information (accessed by using %Library.SQLCatalog) and is not returned by a SELECT * query. However, you can explicitly refer to and use a private property in an SQL query.

Subclasses inherit the value of the Private keyword and cannot override it.

In InterSystems IRIS, private properties are always inherited and visible to subclasses of the class that defines the property;
other languages often call these protected properties.

Default

If you omit this keyword, this property is not private.

- ReadOnly (Property Keyword)

- ReadOnly (Property Keyword)

- Specifies that a property is read-only, which limits the number of ways its value can be set.

- Usage
To specify that the property is read-only, use the following syntax:

Property name As classname [ ReadOnly ];

Otherwise, omit this keyword or place the word Not immediately before the keyword.

Important:

Do not use the ReadOnly keyword with collection properties.

Details
This keyword specifies that you cannot set the v alue of that property by using an object reference. If you attempt to set the
value of a read-only property using an object reference, such as:

set oref.Name = "newvalue"

then there is a <CANNOT SET THIS PROPERTY> error at runtime.

. Similarly, when a property is defined as read-only , the field in the corresponding SQL table is also defined as read-only You cannot explicitly insert or update a read-only field via SQL statements. An attempt to do so results in an SQL error with an SQLCODE of -138.

You can specify the value of a read-only property in the following ways:

- Via the InitialExpression keyword.

- Via the SQLComputeCode keyword.

- Within a property method as described in Using and Overriding Property Methods.

Note that each of these techniques has specific limitations.

Notes

If a property is marked as both read-only and required, note the following difference in behavior between object access and
SQL access:

- When you save the object, InterSystems IRIS does not validate the property. This means that InterSystems IRIS ignores the Required keyword for that property.

- When you insert or update a record, InterSystems IRIS does consider the Required keyword for the property.

Default

If you omit this keyword, the property is not read-only.

- Property Syntax and Keywords

- Required (Property Keyword)

- Specifies that the property must contain a value. For an XML-enabled class, specifies that the element to which the property is mapped is required.

Required (Property Keyword)

Usage
To specify that the property is required, use the following syntax:

Property name As classname [ Required ];

Otherwise, omit this keyword or place the word Not immediately before the keyword.

Details
For any class, this keyword specifies that the property must contain a v alue.

For a persistent class, this keyword specifies that the property must be gi ven a value before the containing object can be
stored to disk; an error occurs if the property does not have a value.

If a property is of type %Stream, the stream cannot be a null stream. That is, the stream property is considered to have a value if the %IsNull() method returns 0.

For a class that extends %XML.Adaptor, this keyword affects the corresponding XML schema. If a property is marked Required, then the corresponding element in the schema does not have minOccurs="0" and is thus considered required. See Projecting Objects to XML. Note that in this case, the class does not have to be a persistent class. XML schema validation
occurs when InterSystems IRIS reads an XML document; see Using XML Tools.

In a subclass, you can mark an optional property as required, but you cannot do the reverse.

Notes

If a property is marked as both read-only and required, note the following difference in behavior between object access and
SQL access:

- When you save the object, InterSystems IRIS does not validate the property. This means that InterSystems IRIS ignores the Required keyword for that property.

- When you insert or update a record, InterSystems IRIS does consider the Required keyword for the property.

Default

If you omit this keyword, the property is not required.

- Property Syntax and Keywords

- ServerOnly (Property Keyword)

- Specifies whether this property is projected to a Java client.

- Usage
To specify whether the property is projected to a Java client, use the following syntax:

Property name As classname [ ServerOnly = n ];

Where n is one of the following:

- 0 means that this property is projected.

- 1 means that this property is not projected.

Details
This keyword specifies whether a property is projected to a Ja va client.

Default

If you omit this keyword, the property is projected.

- SqlColumnNumber (Property Keyword)

- SqlColumnNumber (Property Keyword)

- Specifies the SQL column number for this property. Applies only to persistent classes.

- Usage
To specify the SQL column number for the property, use the following syntax:

Property name As classname [ SqlColumnNumber = 4 ];

Where n is a number between 2 and 4096, inclusive.

Details
This keyword lets you explicitly set the SQL column order for this property. The SQL column order is used when querying the table through a SELECT * statement, or using an INSERT or LOAD DATA command without specifying the column order explicitly.

Setting this property keyword enables you to decouple the order implied by your class definition from the SQL projection of this class as a table.

Default

The default is an empty string.

- Property Syntax and Keywords

- SqlComputeCode (Property Keyword)

- Specifies code that sets the v alue of this property.

- Usage
To specify how the property is computed, use the following syntax:

Property name As classname [ SqlComputeCode = { Set {FieldName} = Expression }, SqlComputed ];

Where:

- FieldName — The SQL field name of the property being defined.

- Expression — ObjectScript expression that specifies the v alue of the property.

Details
If this keyword is specified (and if SqlComputed is true), then this property is a computed property. See Defining a Computed
Property.

For the value of this keyword, specify (in curly braces) a line of ObjectScript code that sets the value of the property,
according to the following rules:

- To refer to this property, use {*}

- Or if the SqlFieldName keyword is not specified for the property , use {propertyname} where propertyname is the
property name. If the SqlFieldName keyword is specified for the property , use {sqlfieldnamevalue} where
sqlfieldname value is the value of that keyword.

- Note that SqlFieldName is available for all object classes, although it is useful only for persistent classes.

- For further information on field names in ObjectScript code, see Controlling the SQL Projection of Literal Properties or see CREATE TRIGGER.

- Similarly, to refer to another property, if the SqlFieldName keyword is not specified for the property , use
{propertyname} where propertyname is the property name. If the SqlFieldName keyword is specified for the
property, use {sqlfieldnamevalue} where sqlfieldname value is the value of that keyword.

- You cannot use arrow syntax or relative dot syntax within {propertyname}. For example, the following kinds of
expressions are not supported: {objectprop.propA} and {objectprop->propA}

The code can include multiple Set commands, if necessary. Blank spaces are permitted before or after the equal sign, though each entire Set statement must appear on a single line.

The code can refer to class methods (not instance methods), routines, or subroutines via the usual full syntax. Similarly, it can use ObjectScript functions and operators.

The code can include embedded SQL.

The code can include the following pseudo-field reference v ariables, which are translated into specific v alues at class
compilation time:

–

–

–

{%%CLASSNAME} and {%%CLASSNAMEQ} both translate to the name of the class which projected the SQL
table definition. {%%CLASSN AME} returns an unquoted string and {%%CLASSNAMEQ} returns a quoted
string.

{%%TABLENAME} translates to the fully qualified name of the table , returned as a quoted string.

{%%ID} translates to the RowID name. This reference is useful when you do not know the name of the RowID
field.

SqlComputeCode (Property Keyword)

These names are not case-sensitive.

- The compute code must be written in ObjectScript. To specify code in other languages, such as Python, specify a PropertyComputation class method instead. PropertyComputation is the name of the property being computed. For more details, see Computed Values.

If you specify both SqlComputeCode and a PropertyComputation method, SqlComputeCode overrides
PropertyComputation.

- The code cannot use syntax of the form ..propertyname or ..methodname()

For example:

Property TestProp As %String [ SqlComputeCode = {set {*} = {OtherField}}, SqlComputed ];

For another example:

Property FullName As %String [ SqlComputeCode = {set {*}={FirstName}_" "_{LastName}}, SqlComputed ];

The code is called with a Do command.

Important:

- If you intend to index this field, use deterministic code, rather than nondeterministic code. InterSystems IRIS cannot maintain an index on the results of nondeterministic code because it is not possible to reliably remove stale index key values. (Deterministic code returns the same value every time when
passed the same arguments. So for example, code that returns $h is nondeterministic, because $h is
modified outside of the control of the function.)

- Any user variables used in the SqlComputeCode should be New'd before they are used. This prevents any conflict with v ariables of the same name elsewhere in related code.

Default

The default is an empty string.

- Property Syntax and Keywords

- SqlComputed (Property Keyword)

- Specifies whether that this is a computed property.

- Usage
To specify that this property is computed, use the following syntax:

Property name As classname [ SqlComputeCode = sqlcomputecode, SqlComputed ];

Where sqlcomputecode specifies the code used the compute the property , as described in SqlComputeCode. If the compute code is defined in a PropertyComputation method, omit SqlComputeCode. For more details, see Computed Values.

If the property is not computed, omit this keyword or place the word Not immediately before the keyword.

Details
If this keyword is true (and if the property also specifies SqlComputeCode), then this property is a computed property. For options and other details, see Defining a Computed Property .

If a property has a value for the SqlComputed keyword, InterSystems IRIS uses that value to compute the property. Specifically , a new class method, <property>Compute, is generated from SqlComputeCode. This method is called from the property’s <property>Get method. If the property also has SqlComputeOnChange keyword specified, then the <property>Compute method is called at the specified times.

This functionality is implemented in the <property>Get and <property>Set methods. If you override either of those methods, then property computations do not work unless there are provisions in the overridden method implementations to trigger computations.

Default

If you omit this keyword, this property is not computed.

- SqlComputeOnChange (Property Keyword)

- SqlComputeOnChange (Property Keyword)

- This keyword controls when the property is recomputed. Applies only to triggered computed properties.

- Usage
To specify when a property is recomputed, use the following syntax:

Property name As classname [ SqlComputed, SqlComputeCode=sqlcomputecode, SqlComputeOnChange =
propertynames ];

Where:

- sqlcomputecode specifies the code used the compute the property , as described in SqlComputeCode. If the compute code is defined in a PropertyComputation method instead, omit SqlComputeCode. For more details, see Computed
Values.

- propertynames is either a single property name or a comma-separated list of property names. This value can also include the values %%INSERT or %%UPDATE. Note that you must use the actual property names, rather than the values given by SqlFieldname.

Details
This keyword applies only to triggered computed properties; it is ignored for other properties. (A triggered computed
property is a property for which SqlComputed is true and SqlComputeCode is specified, b ut for which Calculated and Transient are both false. See Defining a Computed Property .)

This keyword controls the conditions under which this property is recomputed. Recomputation can result from:

- The modification of an y specified properties.

- The occurrence of a triggering event.

If the keyword has a value of %%INSERT or %%UPDATE, then INSERT or UPDATE calls, respectively, specify eventtriggered computation of the value of the field (property).

- With %%INSERT, InterSystems IRIS computes the field v alue when a row is inserted into the table. InterSystems IRIS invokes the code specified in the SQLComputeCode keyword to set the value. If SQLComputeCode uses the same
field as an input v alue, then InterSystems IRIS uses the value explicitly provided for that field; if no v alue is given,
InterSystems IRIS uses the InitialExpression (if this is specified) or null (if InitialExpression is not specified).

- With %%UPDATE, InterSystems IRIS computes the field v alue when a row is inserted into the table and recomputes it when a row is updated. In both cases, InterSystems IRIS invokes the code specified in the SQLComputeCode keyword to set the value. If SQLComputeCode uses the same field as an input v alue, then InterSystems IRIS uses the value
explicitly provided for that field; if no v alue is given, InterSystems IRIS uses the previous field v alue.

Any event-triggered computation occurs immediately before validation and normalization (which themselves are followed by writing the value to the database).

In this example, property LastUpdate is updated with the current date and time when a row is inserted or updated:

Property LastUpdate As %TimeStamp [ SqlComputeCode = {set {*}=$ZDATETIME($HOROLOG,3)}, SqlComputed,
SqlComputeOnChange = (%%INSERT, %%UPDATE) ];

Note:

Event-triggered computation of a field’ s value may override any explicitly specified v alue for the property, depending on the code that computes the property’s value.

Property Syntax and Keywords

Default

The default value for the SqlComputeOnChange keyword is an empty string.

- SqlFieldName (Property Keyword)

- SqlFieldName (Property Keyword)

- Specifies the field name to use for this

- property in the SQL projection. Applies to persistent classes.

Usage
To override the default name for this property when the table is projected to SQL, use the following syntax:

Property name As classname [ SqlFieldName = sqlfieldname ];

Where sqlfieldname is an SQL identifier .

Details
This keyword specifies the column name used to identify the property in its SQL projection.

Default

If you omit this keyword, the property name is used as the SQL column name.

- Property Syntax and Keywords

- SqlListDelimiter (Property Keyword)

- Specifies the delimiter character used within SQL for lists. Applies to list properties in persistent classes. For use only by legacy applications.

- Usage
To specify the delimiter character used within SQL for this list property, use the following sytnax:

Property Name As List Of Classname [ SqlListDelimiter = """delimiter""", SqlListType = DELIMITED ];

Where delimiter is a delimiter character.

Details
This keyword specifies the delimiter character used within SQL for this property if it is a list and if SqlListType is DELIMITED or SUBNODE. This keyword is provided to support legacy applications.

Default

The default value for the SqlListDelimiter keyword is an empty string.

Example

Property Things As list Of %String [ SqlListDelimiter = """,""", SqlListType = DELIMITED ];

- SqlListType (Property Keyword) Specifies the v alues of this field are represented in memory in SQL and stored on disk. Applies only to list properties in persistent classes. For use only by legacy applications.

SqlListType (Property Keyword)

Usage

Property Name As List Of Classname [ SqlListType = sqllisttype ];

Where sqllisttype is one of the following:

- LIST — the list is stored in $List() format in memory and on disk. This is the default.

- DELIMITED — the list is stored as a delimited string in memory and on disk. The delimiter is specified by SqlListDelimiter keyword.

- SUBNODE — the list is stored in subnodes on disk; that is, each list element in a separate global node. The in-memory
value of the field is $List format if SqlListDelimiter is not specified. If SqlListDelimiter is specified, the in-memory
format is a delimited string.

Details
SqlListType controls how the values of a field are represented in memory in SQL, and ho w they stored on disk.

This keyword is provided to support legacy applications.

Default

The default is LIST.

- Property Syntax and Keywords Transient (Property Keyword) Specifies whether the property is stored in the database. Applies only to persistent classes.

Usage
To specify that the property is not stored in the database, use the following syntax:

Property name As classname [ Transient ];

Otherwise, omit this keyword or place the word Not immediately before the keyword.

Details
In the case of a persistent class, specifies that the property is not stored in the database.

Note that InterSystems IRIS validates transient properties in the same way as other properties. For example, when you try to save the object, the system validates all its properties, including any transient properties.

In a subclass, you can mark a non-transient property as transient, but you cannot do the reverse.

Default

If this keyword is omitted, the property is not transient.

- Query Syntax and Keywords

- This reference describes the syntax and keywords that apply to a class query.

- Query Syntax and Keywords

- Syntax of Queries in Class Definitions Describes the structure of a query definition.

Introduction
A class query is a named query that is part of a class structure and that can be accessed via dynamic SQL.

You can define class queries within an y class; there is no requirement to contain them within persistent classes.

Details
A query definition has the follo wing structure:

/// description
Query name(formal_spec) As classname [ keyword_list ]
{ implementation }

Where:

- description (optional) is intended for display in the Class Reference. The description is blank by default. See Creating
Class Documentation.

- name (required) is the name of the query. This must be a valid class member name, and must not conflict with an y other class member names.

- formal_spec (optional) specifies the list of ar guments that are passed to the query.

Specifically , this is the list of arguments that are passed to the query via the Execute() method of the associated query class.

See the comments for formal_spec in Syntax of Methods in Class Definitions .

- classname (required) specifies the query class used by this query .

This is typically %SQLQuery for SQL-based queries and %Query for custom queries. See Class Queries.

Note:

Custom class queries are not supported for sharded classes.

- keyword_list (optional) is a comma-separated list of keywords that further define the query .

See Query Syntax and Keywords for a complete keyword list.

If this list is omitted, also omit the square brackets.

- implementation (optional) is zero or more lines of code that define the query .

Class Limits

- ClientName (Query Keyword)

- ClientName (Query Keyword)

- An alias used by client projections of this query.

- Usage
To override the default name for the query when it is projected to a client language, use the following syntax:

Query name(formal_spec) As classname [ ClientName = clientname ] { //implementation }

Where clientname is the name to use in the client language.

Details
This keyword lets you define an alternate name for a query when it is projected to a client language. This is especially useful if the query name contains characters that are not allowed in the client language.

Default

If you omit this keyword, the query name is used as the client name.

- Query Syntax and Keywords

- Final (Query Keyword) Specifies whether this query is final (cannot be o verridden in subclasses).

Usage
To specify that a query is final, use the follo wing syntax:

Query name(formal_spec) As classname [ Final ] { //implementation }

Otherwise, omit this keyword or place the word Not immediately before the keyword.

Details
A class member that is marked as final cannot be overridden in subclasses.

Default

If you omit this keyword, the query is not final.

- Internal (Query Keyword)

- Internal (Query Keyword) Specifies whether this query definition is internal (not displayed in the class documentation).

Usage
To specify that this query definition is internal, use the follo wing syntax:

Query name(formal_spec) As classname [ Internal ] { //implementation }

Otherwise, omit this keyword or place the word Not immediately before the keyword.

Default
Internal class members are not displayed in the class documentation. This keyword is useful if you want users to see a class but not see all its members.

Default

If you omit this keyword, this query is displayed in the class documentation.

- Query Syntax and Keywords

- Private (Query Keyword) Specifies whether the query is private.

Usage
To specify this query is private, use the following syntax:

Query name(formal_spec) As classname [ Private ] { //implementation }

Otherwise, omit this keyword or place the word Not immediately before the keyword.

Details
Private class members can be used only by other members of the same class (or its subclasses). Note that other languages often use the word protected to describe this kind of visibility and use the word private to mean invisibility from subclasses.

Default

If you omit this keyword, this query is not private.

- Requires (Query Keyword)

- Requires (Query Keyword) Specifies a list of pri vileges a user or process must have to call this query.

Usage
To specify that this query should be restricted to users or processes that have the specified pri vileges, use the following
syntax:

Query name(formal_spec) As classname [ Requires = privilegelist ] { //implementation }

Where privilegelist is either a single privilege or a comma-separated list of privileges, enclosed in quotation marks. Each privilege takes the form resource:permission, where permission is Use, Read, or Write (or the single-letter abbreviations
U, R, or W). For example:

Requires="%DB_USER:R"

Requires="%DB_USER:READ"

To specify multiple permissions for one resource, concatenate the permissions (in either form) in any order. For example:

Requires="%DB_USER:RW"

Requires="%DB_USER:RWRITE"

Requires="%DB_USER:WR"

Requires="%DB_USER:WRITEREAD"

Details
The user or process must have all of the privileges in the list of privileges in order to call the query. Calling the query without the specified pri vileges results in a <PROTECT> error.

If a query inherits the Requires keyword from a superclass, you can add to the list of required privileges by setting a new value for the keyword. You cannot remove required privileges in this manner.

Default
If you omit this keyword, no special privileges are required to call this query.

- Query Definitions

- Privileges and Permissions

- Query Syntax and Keywords

- SoapBindingStyle (Query Keyword) Specifies the binding style or SO AP invocation mechanism used by this query, when it is used as a web method. Applies only in a class that is defined as a web service or web client.

Usage
To override the default binding style used by the query (when it is used as a web method), use the following syntax:

Query name(formal_spec) As classname [ WebMethod, SoapBindingStyle = soapbindingstyle ] {
//implementation }

Where soapbindingstyle is one of the following values:

- document — This web method uses document-style invocation.

With this binding style, the SOAP messages are formatted as documents and typically have only one part.

In the SOAP messages, the <Body> element typically contains a single child element. Each child of the <Body> element corresponds to a message part.

- rpc — This web method uses RPC (Remote Procedure Call)-style invocation.

With this binding style, the SOAP messages are formatted as messages with multiple parts.

In the SOAP messages, the <Body> element contains a single child element whose name is taken from the corresponding operation name. This element is a generated wrapper element, and it contains one child element for each argument in the argument list of the method.

Important:

For a web service that you create manually, the default value of this keyword is usually suitable. When you generate a web client or service from a WSDL, InterSystems IRIS sets this keyword as appropriate
for that WSDL; if you modify the value, your web client or service may no longer work.

Details
This keyword lets you specify the binding style used by this query when it is invoked as a web method.

For a given query, this keyword overrides the SoapBindingStyle class keyword.

Default

If you omit this keyword, the style attribute of <soap:operation> element is determined instead by the value for the SoapBindingStyle class keyword instead.

For information, see the entry for the SoapBindingStyle method keyword. (Note that the class keyword of the same name affects more parts of the WSDL than the method keyword and query keyword do.)

For information, see the entry for the SoapBindingStyle class keyword.

- SoapBodyUse (Query Keyword)

- SoapBodyUse (Query Keyword)

- Specifies the encoding used by the inputs and outputs of this query, when it is used as a web method. Applies only in a class that is defined as a web service or web client.

Usage
To override the default encoding used by the inputs and outputs of the query (when it is used as a web method), use the
following syntax:

Query name(formal_spec) As classname [ WebMethod, SoapBodyUse = encoded ] { //implementation }

Where soapbodyuse is one of the following values:

- literal — This web method uses literal data. That is, the XML within the <Body> of the SOAP message exactly matches the schema given in the WSDL.

- encoded — This web method uses SOAP-encoded data. That is, the XML within the <Body> of the SOAP message
uses SOAP encoding as appropriate for the SOAP version being used, as required by the following specifications:

–

–

SOAP 1.1 (https://www.w3.org/TR/2000/NOTE-SOAP-20000508/)

SOAP 1.2 (https://www.w3.org/TR/soap12-part2/)

Important:

For a web service that you create manually, the default value of this keyword is usually suitable. When you generate a web client or service from a WSDL, InterSystems IRIS sets this keyword as appropriate
for that WSDL; if you modify the value, your web client or service may no longer work.

Details
This keyword lets you specify the encoding for the inputs and outputs of this query when it is invoked as a web method.

For a given query, this keyword overrides the SoapBodyUse class keyword.

Default

If you omit this keyword, the value for the SoapBodyUse class keyword is used instead.

For information, see the entry for the SoapBodyUse class keyword.

- Query Syntax and Keywords

- SoapNameSpace (Query Keyword)

- Specifies the namespace at the binding operation le vel in the WSDL for this query. Applies only in a class that is defined as a web service or web client.

Usage
To override the default namespace at the binding operation level (when the query is used as a web method), use the following
syntax:

Query name(formal_spec) As classname [ SoapNameSpace = "soapnamespace", WebMethod ] { //implementation
}

Where soapnamespace is a namespace URI. Note that if the URI includes a colon (:), the string must be quoted. That is,
you can use the following:

Query MyQuery() [ SoapNameSpace = "http://www.mynamespace.org", WebMethod ]

Or the following:

Query MyQuery() [ SoapNameSpace = othervalue, WebMethod ]

But not the following:

Query MyQuery() [ SoapNameSpace = http://www.mynamespace.org, WebMethod ]

Important:

For a web service that you create manually, the default value of this keyword is usually suitable. When you generate a web client or service from a WSDL, InterSystems IRIS sets this keyword as appropriate
for that WSDL; if you modify the value, your web client or service may no longer work.

Details
This keyword lets you specify the XML namespace used by this query when it is invoked as a web method.

Note:

This keyword has an effect only if the query uses RPC-style binding. That is, the query (or the class that contains it) must be marked with SoapBindingStyle equal to rpc. (If you specify this keyword for a query that uses document-style binding, the WSDL will not be self-consistent.)

For details, see Creating Web Services and Web Clients

Default

If you omit this keyword, the web method is in the namespace specified by the NAMESPACE parameter of the web service or client class.

For information, see the entry for the SoapNameSpace method keyword.

- SqlName (Query Keyword)

- SqlName (Query Keyword)

- Overrides the default name of the projected SQL stored procedure. Applies only if this query is projected as an SQL stored procedure.

Usage
To override the default name used when the query is projected as an SQL stored procedure, use the following syntax:

Query name(formal_spec) As classname [ SqlProc, SqlName = sqlname ] { //implementation }

Where sqlname is an SQL identifier .

Details
If this query is projected as an SQL stored procedure, then this name is used as the name of the stored procedure.

Default

If you omit this keyword, the query name is used as the SQL procedure name.

- Query Syntax and Keywords

- SqlProc (Query Keyword)

- Specifies whether the query can be in voked as an SQL stored procedure.

Usage
To specify that the query can be invoked as an SQL stored procedure, use the following syntax:

Query name(formal_spec) As classname [ SqlProc ] { //implementation }

Otherwise, omit this keyword or place the word Not immediately before the keyword.

Details
This keyword specifies whether the query can be in voked as an SQL stored procedure. In this case, the query is visible via the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.Routines and INFORMATION_SCHEMA.Parameters tables.

Default

If you omit this keyword, the query cannot be invoked as an SQL stored procedure and the query is not visible in the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.Routines and INFORMATION_SCHEMA.Parameters tables.

- SqlView (Query Keyword)

- SqlView (Query Keyword)

- Specifies whether to project this query as an SQL view.

Usage
To specify that the query is projected as an SQL view, use the following syntax:

Query name(formal_spec) As classname [SqlView] { //implementation }

Otherwise, omit this keyword or place the word Not immediately before the keyword.

Details
This keyword specifies whether InterSystems IRIS projects this query as an SQL vie w.

Default

If this keyword is omitted, InterSystems IRIS does not project this query as an SQL view.

- Defining and Using Views

- Query Syntax and Keywords

- SqlViewName (Query Keyword) Overrides the default name of the projected SQL view. Applies only if this query is projected as an SQL view.

Default

If you omit this keyword, the SQL view name is the query name.

- Defining and Using Views

- WebMethod (Query Keyword)

- WebMethod (Query Keyword) Specifies whether this query is a web method. Applies only in a class that is defined as a web service or web client.

Usage
To specify that this query is a web method, use the following syntax:

Query name(formal_spec) As classname [ WebMethod ] { //implementation }

Otherwise, omit this keyword or place the word Not immediately before the keyword.

Details
This keyword specifies whether this class query is a web method and can be in voked via the SOAP protocol.

For requirements for a web method, see Creating Web Services and Web Clients.

Default

If you omit this keyword, the query cannot be invoked as a web method.

Generated Class

When you add this keyword to a class query and compile the class, the class compiler generates two additional classes:

- Package.OriginalClass.QueryName

- Package.OriginalClass.QueryName.DS Where Package.OriginalClass is the class that contains the web method, and QueryName is the name of class query.

For example, suppose that you start with the class ROBJDemo.QueryWS and you add a class query to it named MyQuery. When you add the WebMethod keyword to that class query and compile it, the class compiler generates the following
additional classes:

- ROBJDemo.QueryWS.MyQuery

- ROBJDemo.QueryWS.MyQuery.DS

Do not modify or directly use these generated classes; they are is intended only for internal use.

For a web service, this keyword also affects the generated WSDL, which now contains the additional elements needed to represent this web method.

- This reference describes the syntax and keywords that apply to an SQL trigger, which you can define in persistent classes.

- Syntax of Triggers in Class Definitions

- Describes the structure of a trigger definition.

Introduction
Triggers are code segments executed when specific e vents occur in InterSystems SQL. InterSystems IRIS supports triggers based on the execution of INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE commands. The specified code will be e xecuted either immediately before or immediately after the relevant command is executed, depending on the trigger definition. Each e vent can have multiple triggers as long as they are assigned an execution order.

You can add trigger definitions to persistent classes. They are not meaningful in other kinds of classes.

Details
A trigger definition has the follo wing structure:

/// description
Trigger name [ keyword_list ]
{ implementation }

Where:

- description (optional) is intended for display in the Class Reference. The description is blank by default. See Creating
Class Documentation.

- name (required) is the name of the trigger. This must be a valid class member name, and must not conflict with an y other class member names.

- keyword_list (required) is a comma-separated list of keywords that further define the trigger .

- See Trigger Syntax and Keywords for a complete keyword list.

implementation (required) is zero or more lines of code that define the code that is to be e xecuted when the trigger is fired.

Example

Class Member

/// This trigger updates the LogTable after every insert
Trigger LogEvent [ Event = INSERT, Time = AFTER ]
{
// get row id of inserted row
NEW id
SET id = {ID}

// INSERT value into Log table
&sql(INSERT INTO LogTable (TableName, IDValue) VALUES ('MyApp.Person', :id))

}

Class Limits

- CodeMode (Trigger Keyword)

- CodeMode (Trigger Keyword)

- Specifies ho w this trigger is implemented.

Usage
To specify how a trigger is implemented, use the following syntax:

Trigger name [ Event = sqlevent, CodeMode = codemode ] { //implementation }

Where codemode is one of the following:

- code — this trigger is implemented as lines of code (the default).

- objectgenerator — this trigger is a trigger generator.

Note:

There is an older value for this keyword (generator), which is only present for compatibility reasons. Newer applications should use objectgenerator.

Details
This keyword specifies ho w a given trigger is implemented.

By default, the trigger code consists of one or more lines of code to be executed when the trigger is fired.

If CodeMode is objectgenerator, however, the trigger is actually a trigger generator. A trigger generator is a program invoked by the class compiler that generates the actual implementation for the given trigger. In this case, the trigger code
is responsible for the generated code. The logic is similar to that for method generators; see Defining Method and Trigger
Generators.

Default

The default value is code. That is, by default, a trigger is not a trigger generator.

- Event (Trigger Keyword)

- Specifies the SQL e vents that will fire this

- trigger. Required (no default).

- DELETE — this trigger is fired during an SQL DELETE operation.

- INSERT — this trigger is fired during an SQL INSER T operation.

- UPDATE — this trigger is fired during an SQL UPD ATE operation.

- INSERT/UPDATE — this trigger is fired during an SQL Insert operation or an SQL UPD ATE operation.

- INSERT/DELETE — this trigger is fired during an SQL Insert operation or an SQL DELETE operation.

- UPDATE/DELETE — this trigger is fired during an SQL Update operation or an SQL DELETE operation.

- INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE — this trigger is fired during an SQL INSER T operation, an SQL UPDATE operation, or an SQL DELETE operation.

Details
This keyword specifies the SQL e vents that will fire the trigger .

Default

There is no default. When you define a trigger , you must specify a value for this keyword.

- Final (Trigger Keyword)

- Final (Trigger Keyword)

- Specifies whether this trigger is final (cannot be o verridden in subclasses).

Usage
To specify that a trigger is final, use the follo wing syntax:

Trigger name [ Event = sqlevent, Final ] { //implementation }

Otherwise, omit this keyword or place the word Not immediately before the keyword.

Default

If you omit this keyword, the trigger is not final.

- Foreach (Trigger Keyword)

- Controls when the trigger is fired.

- Usage
To specify when the trigger is fired, use the follo wing syntax:

Trigger name [ Event = sqlevent, Foreach = foreach ] { //implementation }

Where foreach is one of the following values:

- row — This trigger is fired by each ro w affected by the triggering statement. For row-level triggers, you can set the Language keyword to objectscript or python.

- row/object — This trigger is fired by each ro w affected by the triggering statement or by changes via object access. For row-level triggers, you can set the Language keyword to objectscript or python.

- This option defines a unified trig ger, so called because it is fired by data changes that occur via SQL or object access. In contrast, with other triggers, if you want to use the same logic when changes occur via object access, it is necessary to implement callbacks such as %OnDelete().

statement — This trigger is fired once for the whole statement. F or statement-level triggers, you can set the Language keyword to objectscript or tsql.

Details
Controls when the trigger is fired.

Default

If you omit this keyword, the trigger is a row-level trigger.

- Specifies whether this trigger definition is internal (not displayed in the class documentation).

Usage
To specify that this trigger definition is internal, use the follo wing syntax:

Trigger name [ Event = sqlevent, Internal ] { //implementation }

Otherwise, omit this keyword or place the word Not immediately before the keyword.

Details
Internal class members are not displayed in the class documentation. This keyword is useful if you want users to see a class but not see all its members.

Default

If you omit this keyword, this trigger is displayed in the class documentation.

- Language (Trigger Keyword)

- Specifies the language in which the

- trigger is written.

- This reference describes the syntax and keywords that apply to an XData block. Keywords (also known as class attributes) generally affect the compiler.

- Syntax of XData Blocks in Class Definitions

- Describes the structure of an XData block.

Introduction
An XData block is a named unit of data that you include in a class definition, typically for use by a method in the class. Most frequently, it is a well-formed XML document, but it could consist of other forms of data, such as JSON or YAML.

Details
An XData block has the following structure:

/// description
XData name [ keyword_list ]
{
data
}

Where:

- description (optional) is intended for display in the Class Reference. The description is blank by default. See Creating
Class Documentation.

- name (required) is the name of the XData block. This must be a valid class member name, and must not conflict with any other class member names.

- data (optional) contains the payload of the XData block. If XML, it must be a well-formed document (with a single root element), without the XML declaration at its start.

- keyword_list (optional) is a comma-separated list of keywords that further define the XData block.

See XData Syntax and Keywords for a complete keyword list.

If this list is omitted, also omit the square brackets.

Example

Class Demo.CoffeeMakerRESTServer Extends %CSP.REST
{
Parameter HandleCorsRequest = 1

XData UrlMap [ XMLNamespace = "http://www.intersystems.com/urlmap" ]
{
<Routes>

To specify an XML schema against which this XData block can be validated, use syntax like the following:

XData name [ SchemaSpec = "schemanamespaceURL schemaURL" ] { }

Where:

- schemanamespaceURL is the URI of the namespace to which the schema belongs

- schemaURL is the URL of the schema document Note that there is a space character between these items. Also note the use of double quotes.

Details
This keyword specifies the XML schema ag ainst which this XData block can be validated.

Default

If you omit this keyword, the XData block does not provide an XML schema you can use to validate its contents.

Example

XData MyXData [ SchemaSpec = "http:///www.person.com http://www.MyCompany.com/schemas/person.xsd" ]
{
}

- XMLNamespace (XData Keyword)

- Specifies the XML namespace to which an XData block belongs.

Usage
To specify the XML namespace to which an XData block belongs, use syntax like the following:

XData name [ XMLNamespace = "namespaceURL" ] { }

Where namespaceURL is the URI of the XML namespace. Note that this item is enclosed in double quotes.

Details
This keyword specifies the XML namespace to which an XData block belongs.

Default

If you omit this keyword, the contents of this XData block do not belong to any namespace.

Example

XData MyXData [ XMLNamespace = "http://www.mynamespace.org" ]
{
}

- This reference describes the keywords that apply to the storage section of a class definition.

- Note:

This reference does not formally introduce the syntax of storage definitions. F or an introduction to storage definitions, see Storage. Also see Storage Definitions and Storage Classes .

DataLocation (Storage Keyword)

Specifies where data is stored for this class.

Synopsis

<DataLocation>^Sample.PersonD</DataLocation>

Value

The value of element is a global name with optional leading subscripts.

Description
An expression that is the location where data is stored for this class. Normally this would be a global reference such as ^User.PersonD. The global reference can also include one or more leading subscripts. For example,
^User.Data("Person").

It is also valid to use {%%PARENT} in the place of a global or local variable name in dependent classes (child classes
within a parent-child relationship). For example, {%%PARENT}(ChildData). %%PARENT evaluates to the parent’s ID
qualified data location (data location plus parent’ s ID subscript).

The default value for the <DataLocation> element is an empty string in which case the default data location, ^MyApp.MyClassD, is used (where MyApp.MyClass is the class name).

DefaultData (Storage Keyword)

DefaultData (Storage Keyword)

Specifies the def ault data storage definition.

Synopsis

<DefaultData>MyData</DefaultData>

Value

The value of this element is the name of a data storage node within the current storage definition.

Description
Specifies the name of the D ATA definition that the class compiler data structure generator uses to place an y previously unstored properties. A property is unstored if it is storable but is not listed in any DATA definition.

If you add a new, non-transient, property to a persistent class definition, and do not e xplicitly define a storage location for it, then the class compiler will automatically find a storage location for the property within the storage node specified by the <DefaultData> element.

The default value for the <DefaultData> element is an empty string.

Final (Storage Keyword)

Specifies that the storage definition cannot be modified by subclasses.

Synopsis

<Final>1</Final>

Value

The value of this element is boolean value.

Description
Specifies that the storage definition cannot be modified by subclasses.

The default value for the <Final> element is false.

IdFunction (Storage Keyword)

Specifies the system function to be used to assign ne w ID values for a persistent class using default storage.

IdFunction (Storage Keyword)

Synopsis

<IdFunction>increment</IdFunction>

Value

The value of this element can be either increment (to use the $increment function) or sequence (to use the $sequence
function).

Description
If a persistent class does not use an IdKey to determine object ID values, this element lets you specify the function used to
assign ID values (either the $increment function or the $sequence function).

If the class uses the $increment function, new IDs are created by incrementing the value stored at the global location
defined in the <IdLocation> element.

If the class uses the $sequence function, it may reserve blocks of IDs for greater speed in cases of rapid data ingestion. If
not all of the reserved IDs are used, gaps in the ID numbers may result. These gaps may or may not be filled in when subsequent data is ingested. A side effect is that an instance of the class that has a higher ID is not necessarily newer than an instance of the class with a lower ID. In addition, the value at the global location defined in the <IdLocation> element is not directly related to any of the currently allocated IDs.

The default value for the <IdFunction> element is increment for classes created using a class definition.

The default value for the <IdFunction> element is sequence for classes created using a DDL CREATE TABLE statement.

IdLocation (Storage Keyword)

Specifies location of the ID counter .

Synopsis

<IdLocation>^Sample.PersonD</IdLocation>

Value

The value of this element is a global name with optional leading subscripts.

Description
This element lets you specify the global node that contains the counter used to assign object ID values.

By default, in a persistent class definition using def ault storage, this global location contains the highest assigned ID for an instance of the class. However this applies only if the <IdFunction> element is set to increment and the class does not use an IdKey. The value stored at this global location is not meaningful if the <IdFunction> element is set to sequence, and the location is not assigned a value if the class uses an IdKey.

If not specified, a v alue for the <IdLocation> element is generated by the class compiler. Often, the value is ^MyApp.MyClassD (where MyApp.MyClass is the class name), however, it may vary based on a number of factors. For more information on global names for persistent classes, see Globals.

IndexLocation (Storage Keyword)

IndexLocation (Storage Keyword)

Specifies the def ault storage location for indexes.

Synopsis

<IndexLocation>^Sample.PersonI</IndexLocation>

Value

The value of this element is a global name with optional leading subscripts.

Description
This element lets you specify the global used for indexes for this class. If not specified, the inde x location is ^MyApp.MyClassI (where MyApp.MyClass is the classn ame).

Note that you can also specify the storage of each index individually.

The default value for the <IndexLocation> element is an empty string.

SqlRowIdName (Storage Keyword)

Specifies the name used for the ro w ID within SQL.

Synopsis

<SqlRowIdName>IdName</SqlRowIdName>

Value

The value of this element is an SQL identifier .

Description
This element lets you directly specify the name of the row (object) ID column projected to SQL.

The default value for the <SqlRowIdName> element is an empty string.

SqlRowIdProperty (Storage Keyword)

SqlRowIdProperty (Storage Keyword)

Specifies the SQL Ro wId property.

Synopsis

<SqlRowIdProperty>prop</SqlRowIdProperty>

Value

The value of this element is an SQL identifier .

Description
This element is only used by classes that have been migrated from earlier InterSystems products.

The default value for the <SqlRowIdProperty> element is an empty string.

SqlTableNumber (Storage Keyword)

Specifies the internal SQL table number .

Synopsis

<SqlTableNumber>123</SqlTableNumber>

Value

The value of this element is a table number.

Description
This element is only used by classes that have been migrated from earlier InterSystems products.

The default value for the <SqlTableNumber> element is an empty string.

State (Storage Keyword)

State (Storage Keyword)

Specifies the data definition used for a serial object.

Synopsis

<State>state</State>

Value

The value of this element is the name of a data definition within this storage definition.

Description
For a serial (embedded) class, this keyword indicates which data definition is used to define the serialized state of the object (how the object’s properties are arranged when they are serialized). This is also the default DATA definition to which the default structure generator will add unstored properties.

The default value for the <State> element is an empty string.

StreamLocation (Storage Keyword)

Specifies the def ault storage location for stream properties.

Synopsis

<StreamLocation>^Sample.PersonS</StreamLocation>

Value

The value of this element is a global name with optional leading subscripts.

Description
This element lets you specify the default global used to store any stream properties within a persistent class. The value stored at the root location of this global is a counter that is incremented each time a stream value is stored for this class.

Note that you can also specify the storage of each stream property individually; see Declaring Stream Properties.

If not specified, a v alue for the <StreamLocation> element is generated by the class compiler. Often, the value is ^MyApp.MyClassS (where MyApp.MyClass is the class name), however, it may vary based on a number of factors. For more information on global names for persistent classes, see Globals.

Type (Storage Keyword)

Type (Storage Keyword)

Storage class used to provide persistence.

Synopsis

<Type>%Storage.Persistent</Type>

Value

The value of this element is a class name.

Description
This element specifies the storage class that pro vides persistence for this class.

The %Storage.Persistent class is the default storage class and provides the default storage structure.

The %Storage.SQL class is used for mapping classes to legacy data structures.

For serial (embedded) classes, this must be set to %Storage.Serial (which is set automatically by your IDE).

The default value for the <Type> element is %Storage.Persistent.
