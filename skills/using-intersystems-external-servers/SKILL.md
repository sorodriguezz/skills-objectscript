Introduction to InterSystems External

See the Table of Contents for a detailed listing of the subjects covered in this document.

InterSystems External Servers provide instant, fully integrated bi-directional connections between InterSystems IRIS and
external language platforms. External servers support these fast, simple, powerful features:

Instant access

The $system.external interface makes all of your Java, .NET, and Python objects effectively part of the ObjectScript
language. External servers start automatically when you issue a command, providing instant access to your external language platforms without any preliminary setup.

Shared sessions

Shared sessions let ObjectScript and external applications work within the same context and transaction, sharing the same bi-directional connection.

Remote object control

Proxy objects allow either side of a shared session to control target objects on the other side in real time. ObjectScript can create and control Java, .NET, and Python objects, and those languages can create and control ObjectScript objects.

Fully reentrant bidirectional connections

The normal one-way client/server relationship is no longer a barrier. With bidirectional reentrancy, new objects or method calls on either side can enter an existing shared session at any time. This allows applications on either side of a shared session to act as both server and client, initiating client queries and serving requests from the other side.

Reentrant Native SDK methods

Native SDK methods are also fully reentrant and can be included in shared sessions, giving external applications direct access to a huge array of InterSystems IRIS resources.

This document describes how to work with InterSystems External Servers in ObjectScript. The section on “Working with External Languages” provides most of the information you will need to use external servers in your ObjectScript code.
See the “Quick Reference for the $system.external Interface ” for detailed information on all methods covered here. See
“External Server Requirements” for software requirements and optional setup instructions.

Introduction to InterSystems External Servers

External servers use an enhanced and simplified form of the older Dynamic Object Gate way technology. All Object Gateway features are still available, so upgrading your code is a simple matter of replacing certain class and method references (see “Upgrading Object Gateway Code” for details).

The rest of the document describes optional methods for controlling and configuring e xternal servers. See “Managing External Server Connections ” for information on how to view external server activity in the Management Portal, and how to control connections in ObjectScript. The section on “Customizing External Server Definitions ” discusses advanced options that allow you to define ne w external server configurations for special purposes.

The InterSystems Native SDKs are a vital part of the InterSystems External Server environment. They provide the Java, .NET, and Python frameworks that allow your applications to take full advantage of external server connections. See the
following documents for detailed information:

- Using the Native SDK for Java

- Using the Native SDK for .NET

- Using the Native SDK for Python

The $system.external interface allows you to use external language shared library files ( .jar, .dll, .py) from embedded language
code (ObjectScript or Embedded Python). Gateway objects provide connections to InterSystems External Servers running in Java, .NET, or Python environments. Shared library class methods and properties can be called directly from the
$system.external interface, and you can generate an ObjectScript proxy object to access all methods and properties of a
corresponding Java, .NET, or Python target object.

Figure 2–1: Connection between a Gateway object and an InterSystems External Server

- The Gateway process runs in an InterSystems IRIS namespace, and manages the connection for the ObjectScript application. Each gateway can connect to one or more external shared libraries, providing access to all available classes in the libraries.

- The InterSystems External Server process runs in the external language environment (Java, .NET, or Python) and provides the interface to external language shared libraries. Individual server threads provide access to class methods and properties, and manage communications between proxy and target objects.

- A bidirectional TCP/IP connection allows the gateway object and the external server to exchange messages. Each external server process is paired with its own gateway process, using a port number that uniquely identifies the connection.

The following sections demonstrate how to establish connections, define tar gets, and use proxy objects:

- Creating a Gateway and Using a Proxy Object — shows how to create a proxy for an external language object.

- Defining P aths to Target Software — shows how to specify the path to a Java, .NET, or Python class used to create a target object.

### 2.1 Creating a Gateway and Using a Proxy Object

The whole process of starting a connection, creating a proxy object, and calling a method can be compressed into a single statement. The following example starts the Java External Server, creates a proxy for an instance of target class java.util.Date,
and calls a method to display the date:

write $system.external.getJavaGateway().new("java.util.Date").toString()

Sun May 02 15:18:15 EDT 2021

This one line of code demonstrates the entire process of creating and using proxy objects. It establishes a Java gateway connection, creates an instance of class java.util.Date and a corresponding ObjectScript proxy, and writes the date returned by method toString().

Tip:

Try running this call at the InterSystems Terminal. Here are equivalent commands for C# and Python:

write $system.external.getDotNetGateway.new("System.DateTime",0).Now
write $system.external.getPythonGateway.new("datetime.datetime",1,1,1).now().strftime(%c)

The external servers are set up automatically when you install InterSystems IRIS, and will normally work without further attention (if not, see “Troubleshooting External Server Definitions ” — you may have to change the path setting that identifies your preferred language platform).

The previous example compressed everything into one line, but that line is doing three important things:

- First, it creates an ObjectScript Gateway object that encapsulates the connection between ObjectScript and the external
server. You can assign the gateway to a persistent variable:

- set javaGate = $system.external.getJavaGateway() Next it calls the gateway object’s new() method, which creates an instance of java.util.Date in an external server thread and a corresponding proxy object in the ObjectScript process. The proxy object can also be assigned to a persistent
variable:

set dateJava = javaGate.new("java.util.Date")

- Finally, it calls a proxy object method. The target object echoes the call and returns the result to the proxy:

write dateJava.toString()

The following examples demonstrate these steps for all supported languages.

Creating gateway objects

There are specific g ateway creation methods for the Java, .NET, and Python External Servers: getJavaGateway(), getDotNetGateway(), and getPythonGateway(). Each of these methods starts its external server in the default
configuration and returns a Gateway object to manage the connection:

set javaGate = $system.external.getJavaGateway()
set netGate = $system.external.getDotNetGateway()
set pyGate = $system.external.getPythonGateway()

There is also a generic getGateway() method for use with customized external server configurations (see “Customizing External Server Definitions ” for details) but the defaults should be sufficient for most purposes.

Creating proxy objects

Each gateway object has a new() method for creating target and proxy objects. Each call to new() specifies a class name and any required arguments. When the call is made, the external server creates a target instance of the class, and the gateway creates a corresponding proxy object that has the same set of methods and properties as the target. Each call to the proxy is echoed by the target, which returns the result to the proxy.

This example creates three proxy objects connected through three different external servers (since each language
requires its own server):

set javaProxy = javaGate.new("java.util.Date") set netProxy = netGate.new("System.DateTime",0) set pyProxy = pyGate.new("datetime.datetime",1,1,1).now()

Each proxy can be treated like any other ObjectScript object. All three can be used in the same ObjectScript application.

Calling proxy object methods and properties

You can use method and property calls from all three proxy objects in the same statement:

write !," Java: "_javaProxy.toString(),!," .NET: "_netProxy.Now,!, "Python:
"_pyProxy.strftime("%c")

Java: Wed Jun 12 18:55:34 EDT 2024 .NET: 2024-06-12 18:56:25.7779755 Python: Wed Jun 12 18:55:37 2024

The Java and Python examples are method calls, and the .NET example uses a property.

So far the examples have only used system classes (which are easy to demonstrate because they’re available at all times). In other cases, you will have to specify the location of a class before it can be used. For details, see “Defining P aths to Target Software ” later in this section.

Tip:

Controlling ObjectScript Objects with External Language Proxies

It is also possible to create inverse proxy objects that allow your external language applications to control ObjectScript
objects. For details see the following sections:

- Using Java Inverse Proxy Objects in Using the Native SDK for Java

- Using .NET Inverse Proxy Objects in Using the Native SDK for .NET

- Using Python Inverse Proxy Objects in Using the Native SDK for Python

### 2.2 Defining Paths to Target Software

Gateway objects can store a list of paths to software libraries for a specific language. Ja va gateways accept .jar files, .NET gateways accept .dll assemblies, and Python gateways accept .py (module or class) files.

The Gateway.addToPath() method allows you to add new paths to the list. The path argument can be a simple string con-
taining a single path, or a dynamic array containing multiple paths. For example:

Adding a single path

do javaGate.addToPath("/home/myhome/someclasses.jar") do netGate.addToPath("C:\Dev\myApp\somedll.dll") do pyGate.addToPath("/rootpath/person.py")

The Java and .NET gateways also accept paths to folders containing one or more shared libraries. See “Specifying Python Package and Class Paths” for more advanced Python options

Chaining addToPath()

Gateway.addToPath() returns the Gateway object so it can be chained:

set javaGate =
$system.external.getJavaGateway().addToPath("\Lib1\Some.jar").addToPath("\Lib2\Other.jar")

Adding paths to a dynamic array

The %DynamicArray class is an ObjectScript wrapper that provides a simple way to create a JSON array structure. Use the dynamic array %Push() method to add path strings to the array (see Using %Push and %Pop with Dynamic Arrays in Using JSON). The following example adds two paths to array pathlist and then passes it to the
addToPath() method of a Java Gateway object:

set pathlist = [] do pathlist.%Push("/home/myhome/firstpath.jar") do pathlist.%Push("/home/myhome/another.jar") do javaGate.addToPath(pathlist)

Note:

The path argument can also be specified as an instance of %Library.ListOfDataTypes containing multiple path strings, but dynamic arrays are recommended for ease of use (see “Using %Push and %Pop with Dynamic Arrays” in Using JSON).

The following examples demonstrate how to specify classes for each language.

Defining paths to Java classes

For Java, the path can be a folder or a jar. The following example adds a path to someclasses.jar and then creates a proxy for an instance of someclasses.classname.

set javaGate = getJavaGateway() do javaGate.addToPath("/home/myhome/someclasses.jar") set someProxy = javaGate.new("someclasses.classname")

Defining paths to .NET classes

For .NET, the path can be a folder or an assembly. The following example adds a path to someassembly.dll and then creates a proxy for an instance of someassembly.classname

set netGate = getDotNetGateway() do netGate.addToPath("C:\Dev\myApp\somedll.dll") set someProxy = netGate.new("someassembly.classname")

Defining paths to Python classes

For Python, the path can be a module or a package. When a module is part of a package, the module path must be specified with dot notation starting at the top le vel package directory. For example, the path to module Foo.py
could be specified in either of tw o ways:

- Standard path notation if treated as a module: C:\Dev\demo\Foo.py

- Dot notation if treated as part of package demo: C:\Dev\demo.Foo.py The following example uses a dynamic array to add paths for two different files, both in folder C:\Dev\demo\. File Foo.py contains unpackaged class personOne, and file Bar.py contains class personTwo, which is part of package
demo. Calls to new() create proxies for both classes:

set pyPaths = [] do pyPaths.%Push("C:\Dev\demo\Foo.py") do pyPaths.%Push("C:\Dev\demo.Bar.py")

set pyGate = getPythonGateway() do pyGate.addToPath(pyPaths) set fooProxy = pyGate.new("Foo.personOne") set barProxy = pyGate.new("demo.Bar.personTwo")

It is also possible to assign targets for modules or packages that do not have classes, as described in Specifying Python Package and Class Paths.

#### 2.2.1 Specifying Python Package and Class Paths

The Gateway.addToPath() method allows you to create a list of paths to Python modules or classes (see Defining P aths to Target Software for an overview). The syntax for specifying a Python target differs depending on whether the target is in a package, in a class, both, or neither. The following examples show the path as it should be specified in addToPath() and the class name as specified in new().

In the examples with classes, person is the main class and company is a class that it imports. The imported class does not have to be specified e ven if it is in a separate file.

You can also assign targets for modules or packages that do not have classes, but they are effectively limited to static methods and properties (since you can`t have class instance methods without a class).

no package, no class

Modules with no package and no class use the file name. Note that the ar gument for new() is the filename follo wed
by a period, indicating that there is no class:

do pyGate.addToPath("/rootpath/noclass.py") set proxy = pyGate.new("noclass."))

no package, two classes in one file

Main class person and imported class company are both in file

/rootpath/onefile.py.

do pyGate.addToPath(/rootpath/onefile.py") set proxy = pyGate.new("onefile.person")

no package, two classes in separate files

Main class person and imported class company are in separate files within

/rootpath:

do pyGate.addToPath(/rootpath/person.py") set proxy = pyGate.new("person.person")

package, no class

Packages with no classes use the package name and file name. The actual path for the file in this e xample is
/rootpath/demo/noclass.py. Note that the argument for new() ends with a period, indicating that there is no class:

do pyGate.addToPath(/rootpath/demo.noclass.py") set proxy = pyGate.new("demo.noclass.")

package, two classes in one file

Main class person and imported class company are both in file

/rootpath/demo/onefile.py:

do pyGate.addToPath(/rootpath/demo.onefile.py") set proxy = pyGate.new("demo.onefile.person")

package, two classes in separate files

Main class person and imported class company are in separate files in

/rootpath/demo:

do pyGate.addToPath(/rootpath/demo.person.py") set proxy = pyGate.new("demo.person.person")

This section describes how to start and stop external servers, and how to get information about current server activity. You can do so in either of two ways, interactively through the Management Portal or programmatically through the ObjectScript
$system.external interface:

- Controlling Connections with the Management Portal describes the interactive interface provided by the Management
Portal.

- Controlling Connections with the $system.external Interface describes how to perform the same operations program-
matically.

### 3.1 Controlling Connections with the Management Portal

InterSystems External Server definitions are named collections of configuration settings. These settings are used to construct the commands that start External Server processes. For example, definitions include information such as TCP/IP address, port number, and paths to classes or executables.

The Management Portal provides a page that displays the current status of all defined e xternal servers. It allows you to start or stop external servers, and to control and monitor gateway connections. All of the definitions listed belo w contain default settings configured during installation. See “Customizing External Server Definitions ” for information on modifying these definitions or creating ne w ones.

Note:

By default, all servers require a gateway resource, which allows them be used with a passphrase secured connection. Unless security is disabled, you must have USE privileges on the appropriate resource to start, stop, and connect to a Gateway. Java, .NET, and Python servers require the %Gateway_Object resource. See the InterSystems Authorization Guide for more information.

Figure 3–1: External Servers page (System Administration > Configuration > Connectivity)

To open the InterSystems External Servers page, go to System Administration > Configuration > Connectivity > External Servers. In this illustration, all of the names start with %, indicating that they are the default external server configurations (defined automatically during InterSystems IRIS installation). The %Java Server, %Python Server, an %DotNet Server definitions are the def ault external server configurations for the languages co vered in this document. The other aces (as described elsewhere listed definitions are specialized configurations used internally by other InterSystems interf in relevant documentation).

Note:

Do not confuse %Java Server with %JDBC Server, which is a specialized configuration used internally by other InterSystems interfaces.

Each line in the display identifies one unique configuration, and allo ws you to monitor and control the external server that
uses it. For example, this line lists the default .NET external server configuration:

This line contains the following fields:

- Name is the unique identifier for this collection of configuration settings. The configuration it represents can only be used by one external server instance at a time. Clicking on the Name field brings up an editor that allo ws you to change most values of the configuration (see “Customizing External Server Definitions ” for details).

- Type indicates which language the external server will run under.

- Port displays the port number used by this configuration. You can specify the same port number in two different definitions, but they can’t be used at the same time. No two gateway connections can use the same port simultaneously.

- Activity Log is a link to a page that displays detailed information about all instances of this server definition that ha ve been started or stopped since InterSystems IRIS was started. See “Displaying the Activity Log” in the next section
for information about how to display the same information using the $system.external interface.

- Start/Stop allows you to control whether or not the external server process is currently running. Start will create an instance of the external server and display detailed startup information about the process. If the external server is already running, a Stop command will be displayed instead. See “Starting and Stopping External Servers” in the next
section for information about how to do this with the $system.external interface.

- Delete allows you to delete the external server definition. See “Creating and Modifying External Server Definitions ”
for information about how to create and delete definitions with the $system.external interface.

ut it may be useful to define additional configurations in The default configurations will be sufficient for most purposes, b some cases. See “Customizing External Server Definitions ” for information on how to modify an existing definition or create a new one.

### 3.2 Controlling Connections with the $system.external Interface

This section demonstrates how to use the $system.external interface to start and stop a Gateway process, manage the con-
nection to a Gateway Server, and get information on the status of a Gateway:

- Starting and Stopping External Servers

- Displaying the Activity Log

#### 3.2.1 Starting and Stopping External Servers

The $system.external startServer() and stopServer() methods allow you to start or stop an instance of the specified
external server. isServerRunning() returns a boolean indicating whether the specified e xternal server is currently running.
The method signatures are:

startServer(serverName As %String) as %Boolean

stopServer(serverName As %String, verbose As %Boolean = 0) as %Boolean

isServerRunning(serverName As %String) as %Boolean

InterSystems External Servers are designed to be automatic. An external server will be started (if not already running) when a request for a connection is received, and stopped when the InterSystems IRIS instance that started the server is shut down.

Note:

By default, all servers require a gateway resource, which allows them be used with a passphrase secured connection. Unless security is disabled, you must have USE privileges on the appropriate resource to start, stop, and connect to a Gateway. Java, .NET, and Python servers require the %Gateway_Object resource. See the InterSystems Authorization Guide for more information.

Generally the server is started when an instance of a Gateway object is created. However, you can use the startServer() and stopServer() methods to control an external server even when no Gateway object exists. (This is the same way the Management Portal Start/Stop links work, as described in the previous section, “Controlling Connections with the
Management Portal”).

The following example tests to see if an instance of %Java Server is running. If not, the external server is started and the return value is checked to make sure startup was successful. Finally the external server is stopped and the related
activity log messages are displayed:

Starting and Stopping the Server

This example starts and stops an external server instance that uses %Java Server, the default Java configuration. The isServerRunning() method is used before starting to make sure the server is in the expected state.

set serverName = "%Java Server"
set isRunning = $system.external.isServerRunning(serverName)
write isRunning

The startServer() method returns true (1) if the external server was successfully started:

if '(isRunning) set isRunning = $system.external.startServer(serverName)
write isRunning

The stopServer() method also returns a boolean to indicate success or failure. If the verbose argument is set to
true, it also displays the activity log messages on the console:

set isRunning = $system.external.stopServer(serverName,1)

2020-06-24 13:09:39 Stopping Java Gateway Server '%Java Server' 2020-06-24 13:09:39 Stopping process '89381' that is monitoring the Gateway Server '%Java Server' on port '53180' 2020-06-24 13:09:39 Shutting down the Gateway Server 2020-06-24 13:09:39 Invoking %Connect with Server='127.0.0.1', Port='53180',

2020-06-24 13:09:39 Shutting down Java Gateway Server '%Java Server' 2020-06-24 13:09:39 Return from %Shutdown: OK 2020-06-24 13:09:39 Gateway Server stopped

write isRunning

Activity Log entries can be retrieved at a later time, as described in the following section.

#### 3.2.2 Displaying the Activity Log

The getActivity() method returns a set of Activity Log entries for the specified InterSystems External Serv er. The method
signature is:

getActivity(serverName As %String, entryCount As %Integer = 10, verbose As

%Boolean = 0) as %Library.DynamicArray

See “Troubleshooting External Server Definitions ” for a description of the Activity Log interface in the Management
Portal.

Each server logs messages about the state of the server. getActivity() returns the specified entryCount number of messages from this log as a dynamic array. If verbose is true, it will also display the messages on the current device.

you can use dynamic object method %ToJSON() to display the entire list of settings at once.

Note:

The %DynamicArray class is one of several related ObjectScript features that allow you to work directly with JSON strings and data structures. See Using JSON for complete details.

getActivity() as JSON

The following example gets the first three acti vity log entries and displays them with %ToJSON() (linebreaks
added for clarity):

set activity = $system.external.getActivity("%Java Server",3)
write activity.%ToJSON()

[{"DateTime":"2021-05-08 17:19:28","Job":"15037","Port":4013,"Server":"%Java Server",
"Text":"Starting Java Gateway Server '%Java Server'","Type":"Info"},
{"DateTime":"2021-05-08 17:19:28","Job":"15037","Port":4013,"Server":"%Java Server",
"Text":"Return from RunStartCmd: ERROR #5001: Java executable not found in the given
directory: /nethome/bad/java/path/bin/","Type":"Error"},
{"DateTime":"2021-05-08 17:19:28","Job":"15037","Port":4013,"Server":"%Java Server",
"Text":"An error occurred while trying to start the Gateway Server","Type":"Info"}]

Optionally, the log items can be displayed on the current device by setting verbose to true (1):

getActivity() as formatted display

Here is the same set of log entries as a screen display

set activity = $system.external.getActivity("%Java Server",3,1)

+--------------+-------+---------------------+--------+-------+-----------------------------+ | Server | Port | DateTime | Type | Job | Text | +--------------+-------+---------------------+--------+-------+-----------------------------+ | %Java Server | 4013 | 2021-05-08 17:19:28 | Info | 15037 | Starting Java Gateway Serve | | | | | | | r '%Java Server' | | %Java Server | 4013 | 2021-05-08 17:19:28 | Error | 15037 | Return from RunStartCmd: ER | | | | | | | ROR #5001: Java executable | | | | | | | not found in the given dire | | | | | | | ctory: /nethome/bad/java/pa | | | | | | | th/bin/ | | %Java Server | 4013 | 2021-05-08 17:19:28 | Info | 15037 | An error occurred while try | | | | | | | ing to start the Gateway Se | | | | | | | rver | +--------------+-------+---------------------+--------+-------+-----------------------------+

External server definitions are named collections of configuration settings. These settings are used to construct the commands that start external server processes. For example, definitions include information such as TCP/IP address, port number, and paths to classes or executables.

For most purposes, the predefined e xternal server settings will provide all the functionality you need (see “Managing External Server Connections ”), but you can easily change the default settings if necessary. Alternatively, you can create entirely new external server definitions containing your custom settings.

This section describes how to manage named collections of external server configuration settings, and ho w to create new ones. You can do so in two ways, interactively through the Management Portal or programmatically through the ObjectScript
$system.external interface:

- Portal.

- describes the interactive interface provided by the Management

Customizing Definitions with the $system.e xternal Interface describes how to perform the same operations program-
matically.

### 4.1 Customizing Definitions in the Management Portal

An external server definition is a named collection of configuration settings stored in the InterSystems IRIS database. This information is used to construct the command line that starts an external server process. Each external server definition has a unique name, defining a connection that can only be used by one e xternal server at a time. You can access a definition
by clicking on the name in the External Servers page of the Management Portal:

Figure 4–1: External Servers page (System Administration > Configuration > Connectivity)

Note:

To create and change server definitions as described in this section, you must ha ve the %Admin_ExternalLanguageServerEdit:USE privilege, which by default is held by the %Manager role.

The following sections describe the Management Portal pages used to access existing definitions and create ne w ones:

- The New External Server Form

- Defining External Serv er Configurations for Ja va

- Defining External Serv er Configurations for .NET

- Defining External Serv er Configurations for Python

- Defining Advanced Settings

- Troubleshooting External Server Definitions

#### 4.1.1 The New External Server Form

You must have the %Admin_ExternalLanguageServerEdit:USE privilege to create and change server definitions. In some cases, creating a new server definition may be a con venient alternative to changing the settings of the default server. You can specify language environments, versions, and system configurations that dif fer from the default values for your system. Most configuration settings are optional, with def aults that will be used if no other value is specified.

Each external server definition must include a Serv er Name, a Type (currently Java, .Net, and Python), and a Port. Additional properties depend on the Type, and allow you to define the path to the language platform, paths to user code, and other language-specific options. There are also configurable items for logging, connection parameters, and monitoring.

The External Servers page (System Administration > Configuration > Connectivity > External Servers) contains a Create
External Server button:

Clicking the button brings up the form shown below, which is used to define configurations for all e in this document (External Java Server, External .NET Server, and External Python Server) as well as other specialized types not covered here.

xternal servers covered

This illustration shows the Server Type list with Java as the selected type. In addition to the required Server Name, Server Type, and Port options, the form displays three Java-specific fields. Similar type-specific fields w selected type.

ould be shown for any

The following fields are identical for all languages:

- Server Name Required.

- Unique name that you assign to this server definition. The name is used as the database identifier for the stored definition, and cannot be changed after the definition has been sa ved.

- Server Type Required.

Select Java, .NET, or Python to display the fields used only by the selected language.

Port Required.

Unique TCP port number for communication between the external server and InterSystems IRIS. No two external server connections can use the same port simultaneously.

The following sections show and describe the type-specific fields for

Java, .NET, and Python.

#### 4.1.2 Defining External Server Configurations for Java

See “The New External Server Form” for more information on fields common to all languages. The Class Path, JVM arguments, and Java Home Directory fields are specific to Ja

va.

Figure 4–2: Creating an External Java Server definition

- Server Name (required) — Unique name for this external server configuration.

- Server Type (required) — Select Java to display the fields used only by Ja va external servers (do not select JDBC, which is a specialized configuration related to InterSystems SQL interf aces).

- Port (required) — Unique TCP port number used by this external server configuration.

- Class Path

- This field will be added to the class path. It should include paths to all jar files that contain the tar need to generate proxies. There is no need to include InterSystems External Server .jar files. If you are specifying file paths containing spaces or multiple files, you should quote the classpath and supply the appropriate separators for your platform.

- get classes you will JVM arguments Optional arguments to be passed to the JVM in the command that starts the external server. For example, you can specify settings such as system properties (Dsystemvar=value) or maximum heap size (Xmx256m) as needed.

Java Home Directory

Path to the Java version required by the external server. If not specified, this setting will def ault to the Java Home Directory setting in the Management Portal.

- Advanced Settings — See “Advanced Settings” for details.

Click Save to store the server definition in the database. The Server Name is the unique identifier for the definition, and cannot be changed after the definition has been sa ved.

An existing server definition can be edited by clicking the edit link for that definition on the main External Serv ers page. The Edit page is identical to the page shown here except that the Server Name field cannot be changed.

#### 4.1.3 Defining External Server Configurations for .NET

See “The New External Server Form” for more information on fields common to all languages. The File Path and .NET Version fields are specific to .NET .

Figure 4–3: Creating an External .NET Server definition

- Server Name (required) — Unique name for this external server configuration.

- Server Type (required) — Select .NET to display the fields used only by .NET e xternal servers.

- Port (required) — Unique TCP port number used by this external server configuration.

- File Path

- Specifies the full path of the directory containing the required serv er executable for .NET (see “.NET External Server Setup”), used by the command that starts the external server. If this field is not specified, the startup command will use the default executable for your selected .NET Version.

- When using .NET, some systems may require you to specify <install-dir>\dev\dotnet (the top level directory for all .NET external server assemblies).

.NET Version

Specifies the .NET v ersion required by the external server executable. The .NET options are available for all operating systems. In Windows, versions of .NET Framework are also supported.

Advanced Settings — See “Defining Advanced Settings” and “Advanced Setting for .NET” for details.

Click Save to store the server definition in the database. The Server Name is the unique identifier for the definition, and cannot be changed after the definition has been sa ved.

An existing server definition can be edited by clicking the edit link for that definition on the main External Serv ers page. The Edit page is identical to the page shown here except that the Server Name field cannot be changed.

#### 4.1.4 Defining External Server Configurations for Python

See “The New External Server Form” for more information on fields common to all languages. The Python Executable Path and Python Options fields are specific to Python.

Figure 4–4: Creating an External Python Server definition

- Server Name (required) — Unique name for this external server configuration.

- Server Type (required) — Select Python to display the fields used only by Python e xternal servers.

- Port (required) — Unique TCP port number used by this external server configuration.

- Python Executable Path

- Fully qualified filename of the Python e if there is a default Python interpreter that can be used without specifying its location.

- xecutable that will be used to run the external server. This setting is optional

Python Options

Optional property that defines e xtra command line settings to be included when constructing the Python command that starts the external server.

Advanced Settings — See “Defining Advanced Settings” and “Advanced Setting for Python” for details.

Click Save to store the server definition in the database. The Server Name is the unique identifier for the definition, and cannot be changed after the definition has been sa ved.

An existing server definition can be edited by clicking the edit link for that definition on the main External Serv ers page. The Edit page is identical to the page shown here except that the Server Name field cannot be changed.

#### 4.1.5 Defining Advanced Settings

The default values of the Advanced Settings do not have to be changed in most cases.

##### 4.1.5.1 Advanced Options for All External Servers

The following options are available for Java, .NET, and Python.

Figure 4–5: Advanced Settings used by all External Servers

- Resource Required By default, all servers require a gateway resource, which allows them be used with a passphrase secured connection. Java, .NET, and Python servers require the %Gateway_Object resource with USE permission. A system administrator can create customized resources and make them required resources for using any specific Gate way. This field can also be set to an empty string, making the gateway public, but InterSystems strongly recommends protecting all gateways with the appropriate resource. See the InterSystems Authorization Guide for more information.

- Log File Full pathname of the log file on the host machine. External serv er messages are logged for events such as opening and closing connections to the server, and for error conditions encountered when mapping target classes to proxy classes. Due to performance considerations, this optional property should only be used for debugging.

Allowed IP Addresses

IP address or name of the host machine where the external server will run. The default is "127.0.0.1" (the local machine). Specify "0.0.0.0" to listen on all IP addresses local to the machine (127.0.0.1, VPN address, etc.).

Use Shared Memory

Indicates whether to use shared memory if available (default is true).

Initialization Timeout

Number of seconds to wait before assuming that external server initialization has failed.

Connection Timeout

Number of seconds to wait before assuming that an attempt to connect to the external server has failed.

- 4.1.5.2 Advanced Setting for .NET

- In addition to the settings described in “Options for All External Servers ” the .NET advanced settings include an option
to execute the external server as 32–bit:

- Execute as 32-bit — applies only to external servers on 64-bit platforms. If this property is checked, the external server will be executed as 32-bit. Defaults to 64-bit execution.

- 4.1.5.3 Advanced Settings for Python

- In addition to the settings described in “Options for All External Servers ” the Python advanced settings include options
for TSL/SSL configuration (see “Create or Edit a TLS Configuration ”):

- SSL Server Configuration — name of the SSL/TLS configuration to be used for serv er TLS/SSL.

- SSL Cient Configuration — name of the SSL/TLS configuration to be used for client TLS/SSL.

- Verify SSL Host Name — If this property is checked, the TLS/SSL client will perform hostname verification.

#### 4.1.6 Troubleshooting External Server Definitions

All supported languages require the language platform to be properly installed and available to InterSystems IRIS. If an external server does not start, error messages in the Activity Log will often point to the cause. The most common configuration problem is an invalid path to the language platform.

The External Servers page (System Administration > Configuration > Connectivity > External Servers) contains a listing for
each default external server configuration:

Figure 4–6: InterSystems External Servers (System Administration > Configuration > Connectivity)

The default external servers described in this document are %DotNet Server, %Java Server, and %Python Server. You can display all previous Start and Stop messages for an external server by clicking on the Activity Log link.

You can test an external server by clicking Start. This will display the startup commands, and will list error messages if
the external server fails to start. For example, the following message indicates that the path to the Java executable is wrong:

Figure 4–7: Example of an error message on startup

To generate this example, the %Java Server Java Home setting was deliberately changed to \nethome\java\bad\path.

Note:

The default configuration for the Ja va language is defined in %Java Server. Do not confuse it with %JDBC Server, which is a specialized configuration related to InterSystems SQL interf aces.

Each language has an optional configuration setting that can be used to specify the language path (for details, see the languagespecific Management Portal pages for Java, .NET, and Python).

### 4.2 Customizing Definitions with the $system.external Interface

The Management Portal provides convenient interactive tools for defining and modifying e xternal server configurations
(as described in the previous section), but the same thing can be accomplished in ObjectScript using the $system.external
interface.

Note:

To create and change server definitions as described in this section, you must the %Admin_ExternalLanguageServerEdit:USE privilege, which by default is held by the %Manager role. All of the methods described in this section are used to alter persistent external server definitions. They cannot be applied to a running server instance.

You can create and use an external server definition with a fe w lines of ObjectScript code, specifying exactly the same information you would enter in the Management Portal. You can also access detailed information about all existing external
server definitions:

- Using getServer() to Retrieve Configuration Settings describes how to get complete information on individual definitions.

- Getting Other Information about Existing Definitions describes how to get basic information about all existing definitions.

- Creating and Modifying External Server Definitions describes how to define and modify e xternal server configurations for all languages.

Note: %DynamicObject and %DynamicArray

Many of the methods described in this section accept or return instances of %DynamicObject and %DynamicArray. These classes allow you to work with JSON strings and data structures in ObjectScript. See Using JSON for complete details and examples.

#### 4.2.1 Using getServer() to Retrieve Configuration Settings

The getServer() method of the $system.external interface returns a %DynamicObject containing all configuration settings
for the named external server definition. The method signature is:

getServer(serverName As %RawString) as %Library.DynamicObject

For example, the following code returns the settings for %Java Server, the default Java configuration:

set srv = $system.external.getServer("%Java Server")
write srv

2@%Library.DynamicObject

Since each field is a property of the dynamic object, you can use standard property notation to display the fields you w ant
to see:

write "Name:"_srv.Name_", Type:"_srv.Type_", Port:"_srv.Port,!

Name:%Java Server, Type:Java, Port:4015

You can iterate over dynamic object properties with %DynamicObject methods %GetIterator() and %GetNext() (see “Iterating over a Dynamic Entity with %GetNext()” in Using JSON for details).

Alternatively, you can use dynamic object method %ToJSON() to display the entire list of settings at once. The following examples use getServer() to retrieve all settings for the three default external server configurations ( %Java Server, %Python Server, or %DotNet Server) and use %ToJSON() to display the information.

Displaying an existing Java External Server definition

This example returns and displays a %DynamicObject containing all fields for the def ault Java server configuration
(line breaks added for clarity):

write $system.external.getServer("%Java Server").%ToJSON()

{"Name":"%Java Server",
"FullName":"user3:IRIS_DS2:%Java Server","Type":"Java",
"Port":4015,"LogFile":"","AllowedIPAddresses":"127.0.0.1",
"ConnectionTimeout":5,"HeartbeatFailureAction":"R","HeartbeatFailureRetry":300,
"HeartbeatFailureTimeout":30,"HeartbeatInterval":10,"InitializationTimeout":5, "UsePassphrase":0,"UseSharedMemory":1,"passphraseList":"",
"SSLConfigurationServer":"","SSLConfigurationClient":"",
"JVMArgs":"","JavaHome":"","ClassPath":""}

The last line in this example displays fields used only by the Ja va External Server (see “ Defining External Serv er Configurations for Ja va” for detailed information on each field).

Displaying an existing .NET External Server definition

This example returns and displays a %DynamicObject containing all fields for the def ault .NET server configuration
(line breaks added for clarity):

write $system.external.getServer("%DotNet Server").%ToJSON()

{"Name":"%DotNet Server",
"FullName":"user3:IRIS_DS2:%DotNet Server","Type":".NET",
"Port":4115,"LogFile":"","AllowedIPAddresses":"127.0.0.1",
"ConnectionTimeout":5,"HeartbeatFailureAction":"R","HeartbeatFailureRetry":300,
"HeartbeatFailureTimeout":30,"HeartbeatInterval":10,"InitializationTimeout":5, "UsePassphrase":0,"UseSharedMemory":1,"passphraseList":"",
"SSLConfigurationServer":"","SSLConfigurationClient":"",
"DotNetVersion":"C2.1","Exec32":0,"FilePath":""}

The last line in this example displays fields used only by the .NET External Serv er (see “Defining External Serv er Configurations for .NET ” for detailed information on each field).

Displaying an existing Python External Server definition

This example returns and displays a %DynamicObject containing all fields for the def ault Python server configuration
(line breaks added for clarity):

write $system.external.getServer("%Python Server").%ToJSON()

{"Name":"%Python Server",
"FullName":"user3:IRIS_DS2:%Python Server","Type":"Python",
"Port":4215,"LogFile":"","AllowedIPAddresses":"127.0.0.1",
"ConnectionTimeout":5,"HeartbeatFailureAction":"R","HeartbeatFailureRetry":300,
"HeartbeatFailureTimeout":30,"HeartbeatInterval":10,"InitializationTimeout":5, "UsePassphrase":0,"UseSharedMemory":1,"passphraseList":"",
"SSLConfigurationServer":"","SSLConfigurationClient":"",
"PythonOptions":"","PythonPath":""}

The last line in this example displays fields used only by the Python External Serv er (see “Defining External Server Configurations for Python ” for detailed information on each field).

#### 4.2.2 Getting Other Information about Existing Definitions

The serverExists(), getServers(), and getServerLanguageVersion() methods of the $system.external interface return
information about external server definitions stored in the database. Since these are local database queries, none of the methods require an external server connection.

serverExists()

The serverExists() method returns true (1) if the external server definition e xists, false (0) otherwise. The method
signature is:

serverExists(serverName As %RawString) as %Boolean

For example:

write $system.external.serverExists("foo")

write $system.external.serverExists("%Java Server")

getServers()

The getServers() method returns a %DynamicArray containing the names of all external server definitions. The
method signature is:

getServers() as %Library.DynamicArray

For example:

set srv = $system.external.getServers()
write srv.%ToJSON()

["%DotNet Server","%IntegratedML Server","%JDBC Server","%Java Server", "%Python Server","%R Server","%XSLT Server","JavaGate","NetGate2","PyGate2"]

In this example, the last two names are definitions created by the user (by con vention, only the predefined def ault configurations should ha ve names starting with "%").

getServerLanguageVersion()

The getServerLanguageVersion() method returns the external language version string for the specified e xternal
server definition. The method signature is:

getServerLanguageVersion(serverName As %RawString) as %String

For example

write $system.external.getServerLanguageVersion("%Java Server")

We can get a more useful display by calling the getServer() method to get a dynamic object containing related
information (see “Using getServer() to Retrieve Configuration Settings ” ):

set javaDef = $system.external.getServer("%Java Server")
set LanguageVersion = $system.external.getServerLanguageVersion(javaDef.Name)

write javaDef.Name_" language version is: "_javaDef.Type_" "_LanguageVersion

%Java Server version is: Java 8

#### 4.2.3 Creating and Modifying External Server Definitions

The $system.external interface allows you to manipulate external server definitions with the createServer(), modifyServer(),
and deleteServer() methods. These methods work directly with definitions stored in the database, so all three require the %Admin_Manage resource for database access. A definition cannot be altered while the corresponding e xternal server is running.

createServer()

The createServer() method accepts a list of settings in a %DynamicObject and returns a new server definition
(including default values) as %DynamicObject. The method signature is:

createServer(serverDef As %DynamicObject) as %DynamicObject

The set of fields that can be defined in the input list is the same as the set returned by

getServer().

The input definition must specify v alues for all required fields ( Name, Type, and Port) plus values for any other fields you w ant to customize. All input values are validated when createServer() is called. You can specify the
input settings as dynamic object properties:

set def = {}
set def.Name = "AnotherServer" set def.Type = "Java" set def.Port = 5309 set def.ClassPath = "C:/dev/pathname/"

or as a JSON string:

set def = {"Name":"MyNewServer","Type":"Java","Port":5309, "ClassPath": "C:/dev/pathname/"}

Notice that the name in this example does not start with a % character. By convention, only the predefined def ault configurations should ha ve names starting with "%".

The Name value must be unique, so this example calls serverExists() to test it before calling createServer():

set badName = $system.external.serverExists(def.Name)
if ('badName) set srv = $system.external.createServer(def)
write srv.%ToJSON()

{"Name":"MyNewServer","FullName":"user3:IRIS_DS2:MyNewServer","Type":"Java",
"Port":5309,"LogFile":"","AllowedIPAddresses":"127.0.0.1",
"ConnectionTimeout":5,"HeartbeatFailureAction":"R","HeartbeatFailureRetry":300,
"HeartbeatFailureTimeout":30,"HeartbeatInterval":10,"InitializationTimeout":5, "UsePassphrase":0,"UseSharedMemory":1,"passphraseList":"",
"SSLConfigurationServer":"","SSLConfigurationClient":"",
"JVMArgs":"","JavaHome":"","ClassPath":"C:/dev/pathname/"}

Even though only the four required fields and ClassPath are specified in this e xample, the returned dynamic object displays all fields, most of which contain def ault values.

modifyServer()

The modifyServer() method accepts a list of settings contained in a %DynamicObject, and returns a %DynamicObject
containing the modified definition. The method signature is:

modifyServer(serverDef As %DynamicObject) as %DynamicObject

The input dynamic object can be specified as either a JSON string or (as in this e xample) a set of property definitions:

set mod = {}
set mod.Name = "%Java Server" set mod.JavaHome = "/Library/Java/Contents/Home/"

New values can be specified for an y fields e xcept Name and Type (which cannot be changed because they uniquely identify the definition that you are changing).

modifyServer() will throw an error if you attempt to call it while the corresponding external server is running. You can use isServerRunning() to check on the server and stopServer() to stop it if necessary (see “Controlling
Connections with the $system.external Interface” for more information):

set isRunning = $system.external.isServerRunning(mod.Name)
if (isRunning) $system.external.stopServer(mod.Name)
set modifiedserver = $system.external.modifyServer(mod)

The method returns a dynamic object containing all fields of the modified definition:

write modifiedserver.%ToJSON()

{"Name":"%Java Server","FullName":"user3:IRIS_DS2:%Java Server","Type":"Java",
"Port":4015,"LogFile":"","AllowedIPAddresses":"127.0.0.1",
"ConnectionTimeout":5,"HeartbeatFailureAction":"R","HeartbeatFailureRetry":300,
"HeartbeatFailureTimeout":30,"HeartbeatInterval":10,"InitializationTimeout":5, "UsePassphrase":0,"UseSharedMemory":1,"passphraseList":"",
"SSLConfigurationServer":"","SSLConfigurationClient":"",
"JVMArgs":"","JavaHome":"/Library/Java/somename/Contents/Home/","ClassPath":""}

deleteServer()

The deleteServer() method deletes an existing external server definition and returns a dynamic object containing
the deleted settings. The method signature is:

deleteServer(serverName As %String) as %DynamicObject

deleteServer() will throw an error if you attempt to call it while the corresponding external server is running. You can use isServerRunning() to check on the server and stopServer() to stop it if necessary (see “Controlling
Connections with the $system.external Interface” for more information):

set oldServer = "MyOldServer"
set isRunning = $system.external.isServerRunning(oldServer)
if (isRunning) $system.external.stopServer(old)

set deletedDef = $system.external.deleteServer(oldServer)
write $system.external.serverExists(oldServer)

The method returns a dynamic object containing all fields of the deleted definition:

write deletedDef.%ToJSON()

{"Name":"MyOldServer","FullName":"user3:IRIS_DS2:MyOldServer","Type":"Java",
"Port":5309,"LogFile":"","AllowedIPAddresses":"127.0.0.1",
"ConnectionTimeout":5,"HeartbeatFailureAction":"R","HeartbeatFailureRetry":300,
"HeartbeatFailureTimeout":30,"HeartbeatInterval":10,"InitializationTimeout":5, "UsePassphrase":0,"UseSharedMemory":1,"passphraseList":"",
"SSLConfigurationServer":"","SSLConfigurationClient":"",
"JVMArgs":"","JavaHome":"","ClassPath":""}

InterSystems External Server
Requirements

All InterSystems External Servers are set to a predefined def ault configuration automatically on installation. If your language platforms are installed in default locations, no additional configuration should be necessary . If an external server fails to start with the predefined settings, the problem can almost al ways be corrected by setting the correct path to the supporting language platform (see Troubleshooting External Server Definitions for details).

This section provides information on the default location and supported versions for all Java, .NET, and Python external
servers:

- InterSystems IRIS Requirements and Setup

- Java External Server Setup

- .NET External Server Setup

- Python External Server Setup

Important:

A supported version of Java, .NET, or Python 3 must be installed on your system in order to use External Servers for those languages. InterSystems software does not install or upgrade any version of Java, .NET, or Python 3.

External Servers do not require a local instance of InterSystems IRIS. They can be installed and used on any computer that can establish a TCP/IP connection to an InterSystems IRIS server.

### 5.1 InterSystems IRIS Requirements and Setup

To communicate with an InterSystems External Server, your instance of InterSystems IRIS must be version 2020.4 or higher. The default Java, .NET, and Python External Server configurations with be defined automatically if the local def settings for those language platforms can be used. If you wish to use a version other than the default for your system, changes to server configurations will be required (as described in the follo wing sections).

ault

Tip:

Locating <install-dir>

The path to your InterSystems IRIS installation directory can be displayed at the Terminal by entering the following
ObjectScript command:

write $SYSTEM.Util.InstallDirectory()

InterSystems External Server Requirements

### 5.2 Java External Server Setup

Before using the Java External Server, you must install the Java Runtime Environment on your system.

The Java External Server is incorporated into the InterSystems JDBC driver, and will usually be specified automatically for the default Java server configuration ( %Java Server) during installation. If you wish to use a JVM other than the one specified in your JAVA_HOME setting, some extra configuration will be required to set the path (see “Defining External Server Configurations for Ja va”).

### 5.3 .NET External Server Setup

A version of the .NET External Server assembly is provided for each supported .NET version (see Supported .NET Frameworks for details). The correct external server version will be specified automatically for the def ault .NET external server configuration ( %DotNet Server) during installation. If you wish to use a version other than the default for your system, some extra configuration will be required to set the path (see “Defining External Serv er Configurations for .NET ”).

In some applications, the .NET and .NET Framework assemblies may be used to load unmanaged code libraries. Both 32- bit and 64-bit assemblies are provided for each supported version, which makes it possible to create gateway applications for 64-bit Windows that can load 32-bit libraries.

### 5.4 Python External Server Setup

The latest version of the Python External Server package is available on PYPI. and can be installed or updated with pip (do not use the --user option). See the package README file for current requirements.

If a supported version of Python 3 is defined as the def ault on your system when InterSystems IRIS is installed, the correct path to the Python executable will usually be specified automatically for the def ault Python external server configuration (%Python_Server) during installation. If a supported version of Python 3 is not the default for your system, some extra configuration will be required to set the path (see “Defining External Serv er Configurations for Python ”).

Note:

The InterSystems External Server for Python is not the same as InterSystems Embedded Python, which is tightly integrated with a specific instance of InterSystems IRIS. External Serv ers connect to the database over TCP/IP and do not require a local instance. The two systems can be used independently of each other.

Quick Reference for the ObjectScript
$system.external Interface

This is a quick reference to the ObjectScript $system.external interface, which provides ObjectScript with programmatic

stopServer(serverName As %String, verbose As %Boolean = 0, pTimeout As %Integer = 0) As %Boolean

parameters:

- serverName — name of an existing external server definition

- verbose — if true, display entries on the current device; defaults to false

### 6.3 Methods of the Gateway Class

Gateway objects have instance methods that work exactly like the $system.external classmethods of the same name, except
that they do not take a server name as the first ar gument. For example, the following statements create gateways and call
new() in three different ways, but they are all functionally identical:

set date = $system.external.getJavaGateway().new("java.util.Date")

set date = $system.external.getGateway("%Java Server").new("java.util.Date")

set date = $system.external.new("%Java Server","java.util.Date")

#### 6.3.1 Gateway Method Details

addToPath()

Gateway.addToPath() adds one or more paths to the current language gateway path. This function returns the Gateway object to support chaining, and it throws an exception if an error is encountered.

addToPath(path As %String, useProcessLoader As %Boolean = 0) As %External.Gateway

parameters:

- path — string containing a path, or a %DynamicArray or %ListOfDataTypes containing multiple paths

- useProcessLoader — if true, perform some extra steps to ensure that all required files are on the path.

The path argument can be a simple string containing a single path (for Java, this can be a folder or a jar URL). Multiple paths can be added by passing a dynamic array or an instance of %Library.ListOfDataTypes containing the paths to be added.

disconnect()

Gateway.disconnect() disconnects the connection to the external server if it exists.

getExternalLanguage()

Gateway.getExternalLanguage() returns the external language from the external server.

getExternalLanguage() As %String

see also: $system.external.getExternalLanguage()

getExternalLanguageVersion()

Gateway.getExternalLanguageVersion() returns the external language version from the external server.

getExternalLanguageVersion() As %String

getProperty()

Gateway.getProperty() returns the value of a static property from the external class.

getProperty(externalClass As %String, propertyName As %String) As %ObjectHandle

parameters:

- externalClass — name of the external class

- propertyName — name of the external property

see also: $system.external.getProperty()

Help()

Gateway.Help() returns a string containing a list of Gateway methods. If the optional method argument is specified, it returns detailed information for that method.

Help(method As %String = "") as %String

parameters:

- methodName — optional string containing the name of a method for which a detailed description should be returned.

see also: $system.external.Help()

invoke()

Gateway.invoke() invokes external code. If this method is called as an expression then it returns any value returned by the external code.

invoke(externalClass As %String, externalMethod As %String, args... As %RawString) As %RawString

parameters:

- externalClass — name of the external class

- externalMethod — name of the external method

- args... — zero or more arguments to the specified class constructor If no value is returned by the external code then a <COMMAND> exception is thrown. The externalClass is expected to be passed as the name of the external code container. For Java or .NET this is the class name. For Python this can be the name of a class or module. The externalMethod is the name of the external unit of code (function, method, or other language-specific unit) to in voke in the externalClass container. The return value is the value returned by the external code. If the external method does not return a value then invoke() does not return a value.

isServerRunning()

Gateway.isServerRunning() returns true if the server for this Gateway is running.

isServerRunning() As %Boolean

Quick Reference for the ObjectScript $system.external Interface

new()

Gateway.new() returns a new instance of %Net.Remote.Object that is bound to an instance of the external class. Pass externalClass and any additional constructor arguments necessary.

new(externalClass As %String, args... As %RawString) As %Net.Remote.Object

parameters:

- externalClass — name of the external class

- args... — zero or more arguments to the specified class constructor

setProperty()

Gateway.setProperty() sets the value of a static property in the external class.

setProperty(externalClass As %String, propertyName As %String, value As %RawString)

parameters:

- externalClass — name of the external class

- propertyName — name of the external property

- value — new value for the specified property
