# Introducing Interoperability Productions

This article explains how you can connect systems together with InterSystems IRIS® data platform interoperability productions.

For an online hands-on activity that lets you create a simple production that organizes files on a local file system and use file adapters to read and write the files, see Creating a Basic Production in InterSystems IRIS.

### 1.1 Why Connect Systems?

Connecting systems involves allowing messages from one system to be processed by another system. For example, the
following scenarios require connecting systems:

- To improve efficienc y, systems originally designed to perform a single function need to be integrated. For example, you can gain efficienc y by integrating individual systems that track inventory, order materials, record sales, and control shipping.

- After a merger, systems that perform the same function in the separate organizations need to work together for the unified or ganization to be effective.

When connecting systems together, you may be faced with challenges such as:

- Systems use different communication protocols: one system may use TCP, another uses SOAP, and a third uses REST.

- Systems use different messages with different formats or based on different standards.

- You may be required to guarantee that messages are delivered successfully to the right system and be able to detect and correct failures.

- You have to monitor the system transferring the messages, provide a queue for messages if too many come at one time, and monitor overall system performance to ensure that there aren’t any roadblocks.

While it is possible to code a custom application to connect systems, it is much easier and faster to develop an InterSystems IRIS production. InterSystems IRIS provides a framework that allows you to connect systems and either minimizes or eliminates the need for custom code.

InterSystems IRIS Basics: Connecting Systems Using Interoperability Productions

### 1.2 Introducing Productions

An InterSystems IRIS production is an integration framework for easily connecting systems and for developing applications for interoperability. A production provides built-in connections to a wide variety of message formats and communications protocols. You can easily add other formats and protocols – and define b usiness logic and message transformations either by coding or using graphic wizards. Productions provide persistent storage of messages, which allow you to trace the path of a message and audit whether a message is successfully delivered. A production consists of business services, processes,
and operations:

- Business services connect with external systems and receive messages from them.

- Business processes allow you to define b usiness logic, including routing and message transformation.

- Business operations connect with external systems and send the messages to them.

When connecting systems together, it can be challenging to get them to understand the other system’s messages and docu-
ments. For example, consider the following problem:

- You have two separate systems: one is collecting data from multiple networked devices and the other is a work order system that tracks broken devices and the repair process.

- The current process depends on human intervention to monitor the devices and initiate the repair process. This has caused delays and is unreliable.

- You have been given the task to connect the two systems together: to monitor the data being collected and to automate initiating the repair process. You know how to detect faulty devices in the data collection system and know how to initiate a repair, but the two systems store data in incompatible formats even when the data represents the same item.

- You also need to record the actions when a repair is initiated from the data collection system.

You can solve this problem using an InterSystems IRIS production. It provides the framework for defining an interf ace that accepts messages from the data collection system, transforming the message into one that can be understood by the repair system, and then sending it to the repair system. It also stores a record of the message path.

The following illustrates a simple production:

To connect systems, you develop, configure, deplo y, and manage productions, which integrate multiple software systems. This topic introduces productions and some of the basic terminology.

### 2.1 Production Basics

An interoperability production is an integration framework for easily connecting systems and for developing applications for interoperability. A production provides built-in connections to a wide variety of message formats and communications protocols. You can easily add other formats and protocols – and define b usiness logic and message transformations either by coding or using graphic interfaces. Productions provide persistent storage of messages, which allow you to trace the path of a message and audit whether a message is successfully delivered. The elements in a production are known as business
hosts. There are three kinds of business hosts, with different purposes as follows:

- Business services connect with external systems and receive messages from them. Business services relay the messages to other business hosts in the production.

- Business processes allow you to define b usiness logic, including routing and message transformation. Business processes receive messages from other business hosts in the production and either process the requests or forward them to other business hosts.

- Business operations connect with external systems and send the messages to them. Business operations receive messages from other business hosts in the production and typically send them to external systems.

The following figure pro vides a conceptual overview of a production and business hosts.

Introduction to Interoperability Productions

Business hosts communicate with each other via messages. All messages are stored in the InterSystems IRIS® database and can be seen via the Management Portal.

In most cases (but not all), a business service has an associated inbound adapter. The role of an inbound adapter is to accept input from entities external to the production. Similarly, a business operation usually has an associated outbound adapter. The role of an outbound adapter is to send output to entities external to the production. InterSystems IRIS provides a large set of adapters to handle different technologies. For example, you use a different adapter for files than you do for FTP . It is also possible to define your o wn adapters.

The following figure sho ws an actual production, as seen in the Management Portal:

### 2.2 Settings

A production typically includes a large number of settings. Settings are configurable v alues that control the behavior of a
production. Settings can affect a production in many ways. For example, a setting can specify:

The TCP port on which a business service should listen.

How frequently to check for new input.

The external data source name (DSN) to use.

The TLS configuration to use when connecting to an e xternal entity.

How long to stay connected.

And so on.

- ProductionInboundAdaptersBusinessSe...Business...ExternalApplications...ExternalApplications...BusinessOper...OutboundAdapters

- An important feature of InterSystems IRIS is that a system administrator can modify settings while a production is running. The changes take effect immediately. The following shows an example of the web page that the system administrator uses
to make such changes:

- Message Flow in a Production

- The production and its business hosts have settings provided by InterSystems IRIS; they correspond to properties of the
production and business host classes. You can define additional settings in e xactly the same way, by defining your o wn subclasses of InterSystems IRIS classes. You can also remove settings so that the corresponding properties are hardcoded and not configurable.

- 2.3 Message Flow in a Production

- An interoperability production typically processes incoming events as follows:

1. An inbound adapter receives an incoming event, transforms it into a message object, and passes it to its associated

business service.

2. The business service creates a follow-on request message, and passes this new message to a business process or business

operation within the production.

3. A business process that receives a request message executes a predefined set of acti vities, in sequence or in parallel.

These activities may include sending follow-on messages to other business hosts. Business processes are also responsible for most or all of the business logic in the production.

4. A business operation encapsulates the capabilities of a resource outside InterSystems IRIS, usually an external software
application. The business operation transforms properties of the request message object into a format usable by the external application API.

5. An outbound adapter manages the details of communicating with a specific e xternal system or application from within

the production. It transmits the API call to the external entity.

Introduction to Interoperability Productions

6. The response from the external system or application can trigger a cascade of response messages back to the external
entity that started the flo w of events. Details depend on the design choices made by the production developers.

As a demonstration, the following figure sho ws a trace of a set of related messages, which a production sent in response
to an initial message (in this case sent by the testing service in the Management Portal rather than by an exterior source):

The processing can also include workflo w, which makes it possible to incorporate human interaction into automated business processes. Uses of workflo w within the enterprise might include order entry, order fulfillment, contract appro val, or help desk activities. Other Production Options provides more information.

InterSystems IRIS® enables you to define inbound and outbound connections to a wide v ariety of technologies. There are three general categories of options: adapters, specialized business host classes, and gateways.

If the built-in tools do not meet your needs, you can create your own components. Also see the InterSystems Technology
Reference.

### 3.1 Adapter Library

InterSystems IRIS provides many adapters, and you can define your o wn. InterSystems IRIS provides adapters for the
following scenarios:

See Using TCP Adapters in Productions.

Also see Business Host Classes That Use TCP Adapters.

Initiate and manage a Telnet connection.

See the EnsLib.Telnet.OutboundAdapter entry in the Class Reference.

To use an adapter, you define a b usiness host class that uses the adapter class. For a general description of this process, see Developing Productions. The topics in the previous list provide details that apply to the specific adapters.

As noted previously, you can also define your o wn adapters. For information, see Developing Productions.

### 3.2 Specialized Business Host Classes

For specific scenarios, InterSystems IRIS® pro vides specialized business service classes and business operation classes so
that (usually) no coding is needed:

- Files

- FTP

- HTTP and SOAP

- TCP

- REST For practical reasons, the following sections might not cover all the specialized business host classes that InterSystems IRIS provides. To find all the specialized b usiness host classes that specify an adapter, perform a search in an IDE, and look for Parameter ADAPTER within the EnsLib package.

- Any — See EnsLib.TCP.PassthroughService and EnsLib.TCP.PassthroughOperation in the Class Reference.

- 3.2.6 Business Host Classes That Support REST

- InterSystems IRIS provides business host classes that support REST (in this special case, adapters are not necessarily involved). See Using REST Services and Operations in Productions.

### 3.3 Gateways and External Servers

InterSystems IRIS provides the following additional connectivity options:

- The SQL Gateway, which provides access from InterSystems IRIS to external databases via JDBC and ODBC. You can, for example, link to tables and views in external sources and access the data in them in the same way you access any local data. See Using the InterSystems SQL Gateway.

- An InterSystems External Server allows you to instantiate and manipulate objects written in an external language as if they were native objects within InterSystems IRIS. See Using InterSystems External Servers. In most cases, using the PEX framework to interact with an external language from a production is preferred over using the
$system.external interface provided by the external server.

This topic describes the kinds of logic supported in business processes in interoperability productions.

### 4.1 Introduction

Business processes are the middle part of any production. They accept requests from host classes inside the production —business services or business processes—and then either process the requests or relay them to other host classes inside the production for processing.

InterSystems recommends the following division of labor within a production: Use business services to receive input from outside of the production and simply forward it (as messages) into the production. Use business processes to handle any needed business logic. Use business operations to receive messages from within the production and simply generate output for destinations outside of the production. That is, centralize the business logic within the business processes.

Accordingly, InterSystems IRIS® provides extensive support for complex logic within business processes, and this logic can be defined by nontechnical users.

First, a business process can contain its own complex logic. It can also use the following reusable items:

- Data transformations calculate and apply changes to message contents.

- Business rules change the behavior of business processes at decision points or send messages to specific destinations based on message type, message contents, or where the message came from.

InterSystems IRIS provides tools that enable nontechnical users to define b usiness processes, data transformations, and business rules. These users can view and edit the logic visually without programming or diagramming skills.

Note that there is overlap among the lower-level options available in business processes, data transformations, and business rules. For a comparison, see Comparison of Business Logic Tools. It is worthwhile to review these options before deciding how to organize your logic.

### 4.2 Types of Business Processes

InterSystems IRIS provides the following general types of business process:

- BPL processes, which are based on the class Ens.BusinessProcessBPL. To create these processes, you use a graphical editor that is intended for use by nontechnical users. See Developing BPL Processes.

The name of these processes comes from BPL (Business Process Language), which is the XML-based language that InterSystems IRIS uses to represent their definitions.

- Routing processes, which are based on the class EnsLib.MsgRouter.RoutingEngine or
EnsLib.MsgRouter.VDocRoutingEngine.

InterSystems IRIS provides a set of classes to route specific kinds of messages. The following links indicate the routing
process to use for different kinds of messages:

Message Type

See

EDIFACT

Routing EDIFACT Documents in Productions

X12

XML

Routing X12 Documents in Productions

Routing XML Virtual Documents in Productions

To use these classes, no coding is generally necessary. It is, however, necessary, to provide a set of business rules.

- Custom business processes, which are based on the class Ens.BusinessProcess. Note that all the previously listed business process classes inherit from this class. In this case, it is necessary to use a supported IDE to develop custom code.

For information on defining custom b usiness processes, see Developing Custom Business Processes.

A production can include any mix of these business processes.

The following shows a partial example of a BPL business process, as displayed in the BPL editor:

Data Transformations

### 4.3 Data Transformations

A data transformation creates a new message that is a transformation of another message. You can invoke a data transformation from a business process, another data transformation, or a business rule.

When you transform a message, your data transformation swaps out the old message body object (the source) and exchanges
it for a new one (the target). Some of the transformations that occur during this process can include:

- Copying values from properties on the source to properties on the target.

- Performing calculations using the values of properties on the source.

- Copying the results of calculations to properties on the target.

- Assigning literal values to properties on the target.

- Ignoring any properties on the source that are not relevant to the target.

A data transformation is a class based on Ens.DataTransform or its subclass, Ens.DataTransformDTL.

- If you use Ens.DataTransformDTL, the transformation is called a DTL transformation. To create these transformations, you use a graphical editor that is intended for use by nontechnical users. For details, see Developing DTL Transformations.

- The name of these transformations comes from DTL (Data Transformation Language), which is the XML-based language that InterSystems IRIS uses to represent their definitions.

If you use Ens.DataTransform, the transformation is a custom transformation. In this case, you must use a supported IDE. For information on defining these, see Developing Custom Data Transformations.

The following shows an example DTL transformation, as seen in the DTL editor:

### 4.4 Business Rules

A business rule (also known as a business rule set) can return a value, transform data, or both. You can invoke a business rule from a business process or from another business rule.

A business rule is a class based on Ens.Rule.Definition. You define these in the Management Portal, which pro vides a visual
editor for the benefit of nontechnical users. The following shows a partial example, as seen in this editor:

For details, see Developing Business Rules.

### 5.1 User Portal

The User Portal (formally called the InterSystems User Portal) is intended for direct use by end users, in contrast to such
back end tools as IDEs and the Management Portal. The following shows an example:

The User Portal is designed to enable end users to do the following tasks:

- View and dashboards, which can include production business metrics

- View and manage workflo w tasks.

- Send messages to other users of the User Portal, as seen in the upper left corner of the previous figure.

Other Production Options

For details, see Using Dashboards and the User Portal.

Important:

In order to use the User Portal, it is necessary to configure the web application for the namespace so that
it is Analytics-enabled; see Setting Up the Web Applications for Business Intelligence.

### 5.2 Workflow

InterSystems IRIS® supports workflo w within productions. Workflow makes it possible to incorporate human interaction into automated business processes. Uses of workflo w within the enterprise might include order entry, order fulfillment, contract approval, or help desk activities.

A production achieves workflo w using a business process and set of business operations. A business process receives a request, organizes the tasks required to fulfill that request, and then calls upon b usiness operations to perform these tasks.

Each of these business operations assigns the task to a workflo w role, which places the task into the workflo w inbox of each user who belongs to that role. To access this inbox, users work with the User Portal.

When a user marks as a task as complete, the workflo w engine continues with the next processing step.

For details, see Defining Workflo ws.

### 5.3 Business Activity Monitoring

InterSystems IRIS includes all the elements required to include business activity monitoring (BAM) as part of an enterprise integration project.

First, it provides business metrics, which are specialized business service classes that calculate specific v alues at a configurable time interval. These calculations can take a variety of forms, involving calls to business operations, federated databases, the InterSystems IRIS database, or any arbitrary source code contained within the business metric class. See Defining
Business Metrics.

Second, it provides dashboards, which display business metrics. See Creating and Modifying Dashboards.

Alerts

### 5.4 Alerts

An alert sends notifications to applicable users while a production is running, in the e vent that an alert event occurs. The intention is to alert a system administrator or service technician to the presence of a problem. Alerts may be delivered via email or other mechanisms. For details, see Programming in InterSystems IRIS.

### 5.5 Publish and Subscribe Message Delivery

Productions also support publish and subscribe message routing. This technique routes a message to one or more subscribers based on the fact that those subscribers have previously registered to be notified about messages on a specific topic. F or details, see Managing Productions.

### 5.6 Message Bank

The Enterprise Message Bank is an optional remote archiving facility where you can collect messages, Event Log items,
and search table entries from multiple client productions. It consists of the following components:

- The Message Bank server, which is a simple production consisting exclusively of a Message Bank service that receives submissions from any number of client productions.

- A client operation (the Message Bank operation) that you add to a production and configure with the address of a Message Bank server.

To get started, see Defining an Enterprise Message Bank .
