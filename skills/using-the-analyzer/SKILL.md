# Using the Analyzer

This page introduces the InterSystems IRIS® data platform Business Intelligence Analyzer.

You can access the Analyzer from the InterSystems launcher or from the InterSystems User Portal.

### 1.1 Introduction

The Analyzer enables you to create pivot tables, which display aggregated data. Each pivot table is based upon a subject
area or a cube. (In the Analyzer, the terms subject area and cube are equivalent to each other; this book uses the term subject
area.) When you access the Analyzer, you must choose the subject area to work with. The Analyzer then displays the elements defined in that subject area, which you drag and drop to create pi vot tables.

Pivot tables are central to InterSystems Business Intelligence; they select and aggregate data. The following figure sho ws
an example pivot table that shows the number of patients and the average allergy count per patient, grouped by age and gender.

A level is used to group the source data. A level has members. Each member, in turn, corresponds to a specific set of records in the source data. For example, the Age Group level has the members 0-29, 30-59, and 60+. The Gender level has the members Female and Male.

A measure is a value displayed in the body of the pivot table; it is based on values in the source data. For a given context,
a measure aggregates the values for all applicable source records and represents them with a single value. For example, the measure Patient Count is the number of patients, and the measure Avg Allergy Count is the average number of allergies per patient.

Introduction to the Analyzer

The preceding example shows a preview of a pivot table within the Analyzer, which provides a large set of tools for modifying, exporting, formatting, and so on.

### 1.2 Accessing the Analyzer

To access the Analyzer:

1. On your BI instance, log in to the management portal as a user with administrative privileges and ensure you are in

your desired namespace.

2. Navigate to Analytics > Analyzer.

If you see the message Select a Subject Area to Display, do the following:

a.

Click the Change button

or click the Select Subject Area link.

b. Click the name of the subject area.

c. Click OK.

#### 1.2.1 Accessing the Mini Analyzer

To access the Mini Analyzer, you must first display a suitable dashboard. Not all dashboards pro vide access to the Mini
Analyzer.

If a dashboard displays the Mini Analyzer button in the Mini Analyzer.

in a widget, click it; the system then opens the current pivot table

The Mini Analyzer includes only the options that let you make local changes to the pivot table as displayed in this widget. The changes do not affect other widgets, other dashboards, or other users.

### 1.3 Orientation to the Analyzer and Mini Analyzer

This section provides an orientation to the Analyzer and Mini Analyzer. First, consider the upper part of the Analyzer page
(which is not included in the Mini Analyzer):

The key options here are as follows:

- Menu — This drop-down menu provides options to open and save pivot tables.

- Home — This link accesses the User Portal.

- Analytics — This link accesses other Analytics tools.

- Analyzer — This link redisplays the Analyzer. This is useful if there have been changes to the definition of the subject area.

Orientation to the Analyzer and Mini Analyzer

- Namespace — The displayed namespace name is a link that lets you switch to another InterSystems IRIS namespace.

- View — These buttons switch the pivot table display to a chart format or to a table-and-chart format.

- New — This button lets you create a new pivot table.

- Open, Save, and Save As — These buttons let you open and save pivot tables.

- Delete — This button lets you delete the current pivot table.

- Auto-execute — This check box lets you control whether the system automatically executes the pivot table.

- Preview Mode — This check box enables Preview Mode. If Preview Mode is enabled, any sets involved in a CROSSJOIN are truncated using the HEAD function. If truncation occurs, a preview pivot table is displayed in the Analyzer. You can use the Show All button to display full results without affecting the Preview Mode setting.

Note:

The Analyzer automatically enables Preview Mode for a pivot table which involves a resource-intensive query. This avoids the need to recalculate complete results for the query every time you make an edit to the pivot table.

The upper left corner displays the name of the currently selected subject area (in this case, DemoMDX) or the pivot table that you currently editing, if any.

The rest of the page is visible in both the Analyzer and the Mini Analyzer. The following subsections discuss the Model Contents pane, the Pivot Builder area, and the Pivot Preview area. The final subsection discusses ho w the Mini Analyzer is different from the full Analyzer.

#### 1.3.1 Model Contents Pane

Both the Analyzer and the Mini Analyzer include the Model Contents pane on the left. This area lists the contents of the
subject area that you are currently viewing:

See Getting Familiar with a Subject Area for more detail.

Tip: During development, you may find it necessary to reload the model if you ha ve made changes in the Architect or

an IDE. To reload the model, click the Refresh button it affects only the model as shown in this area.

in this area. Note that this does not rerun the pivot table;

Introduction to the Analyzer

You can resize this area. To do so, drag the vertical divider on the right edge of this area.

#### 1.3.2 Pivot Builder Area

To the right of the Model Contents pane, both the Analyzer and the Mini Analyzer include the Pivot Builder area, where
you define a pi vot table:

You can vertically resize this area. To do so, drag the horizontal divider on the bottom edge of this area. You can also
horizontally resize each of the boxes; to do so, drag the dividers between boxes.

#### 1.3.3 Pivot Preview Area

Both the Analyzer and the Mini Analyzer include the Pivot Preview area, which displays a preview of the actual pivot table:

The bottom area looks like this:

Cells displays the number of cells currently selected (or the total number of cells on the page if there is no selection). Total displays the total value of all the selected cells (or of all the cells on the page if there is no selection).

If there is too much data to display on the screen, the lower right corner displays buttons for paging through the results.

You can resize this area. To do so, drag the horizontal divider on the top edge of this area.

#### 1.3.4 Mini Analyzer Differences

The Mini Analyzer is similar to the full Analyzer but has two key differences:

- The Mini Analyzer does not provide options for creating new pivot tables, only for changing the currently displayed pivot table.

- The changes are visible only to yourself. Other users are unaffected.

For information on accessing the Mini Analyzer, see the previous topic.

Displaying a Pivot Table

### 1.4 Displaying a Pivot Table

To display an existing pivot table, do either of the following:

- Click Open, expand folders as needed, select a pivot table, and click OK.

- Select Pivots in the Model Contents area. Then expand folders as needed and select a pivot table.

The system immediately runs the query defined by the pi vot table and then displays the results unless the Auto-execute

option is off. In this case, click the Refresh button the table.

in the Pivot Builder area. The system then runs the query and displays

### 1.5 Exiting the Analyzer or Mini Analyzer

To exit the Analyzer and return to the User Portal, click Home. Any unsaved changes are discarded.

To exit the Mini Analyzer and return to the dashboard from which you started, click either OK or Cancel. The OK option saves your changes, and the Cancel option discards them. Or click Reset to remove any changes created in the Mini Analyzer, and then click OK.

### 1.6 Location of Pivot Table Definitions

When you create a pivot table in the Analyzer, its definition is a vailable within your IDE as a generated .dfi file. If you are
using Visual Studio Code, you can access these pivot table definitions in the follo wing ways:

- Client-side editing: when a namespace is opened in the ObjectScript Explorer, view the .dfi files in the Other directory.

- Server-side editing: modify your workspace filters so that they show generated files and include .dfi files.

A pivot table definition is not a class definition b container class can contain multiple pivot tables and other items. For details, see Packaging Business Intelligence Elements into Classes.

ut can be copied and pasted into a special container class if needed; this

### 1.7 Accessing the BI Samples

Most of the samples shown in the BI documentation are part of the Samples-BI sample (https://github.com/intersystems/Samples-BI) or the Samples-Aviation sample (https://github.com/intersystems/Samples-Aviation).

InterSystems recommends that you create a dedicated namespace called SAMPLES (for example) and load samples into that namespace. For the general process, see Downloading Samples for Use with InterSystems IRIS.

This page presents basic information on creating pivot tables in Business Intelligence.

### 2.1 Introduction to the Autosave Feature

InterSystems IRIS® data platform Business Intelligence provides an optional autosave feature, which can automatically
save the state of the Analyzer for each user, for each pivot table. If the autosave feature is enabled for the Analyzer:

- When you access the Analyzer, the system displays that user interface as you last saw it.

- When you display a pivot table in the Analyzer, the system displays that pivot table as you last saw it.

For information on this option, see Specifying Basic Settings. Note that there is a separate autosave feature for the User
Portal.

### 2.2 Selecting a Subject Area

A subject area provides the elements that you use as the basis of any pivot table. To select the subject area to use:

1.

Click the Change button

or click the Select Subject Area link.

2. Click the name of the subject area.

3. Click OK.

### 2.3 Getting Familiar with a Subject Area

The Model Contents area lists the contents of the subject area that you are currently viewing. For example, this area might
look like this initially:

If you have not worked with the current subject area before, it is useful to examine its contents. First, use the drop-down
list to select the kind of item to display in this area. Select one of the following:

- Dimensions — Select this to display the basic model defined in this subject area. In this case, the Model Viewer can
display the following sections:

– Measures

– Dimensions

–

–

Pivot Variables

Plug-ins

– Named Sets

– Named Filters

– Calculated Members

- Pivots — Select this to display any pivot tables defined in this subject area.

- Quality Measures — Select this to display any quality measures available in this subject area.

- Detail Listings — Select this to display any detail listings defined in this subject area.

The purpose of the Model Content area is to enable you to create pivot tables. To do this, drag and drop items into the Pivot Builder area on the right, as described in the next section.

Tip:

For most items, if you hover the cursor over the name of an item in the Model Content area, the system displays a tooltip that shows the description of the item, if any.

#### 2.3.1 Measures

To display a list of measures, select Dimensions from the drop-down list in the Model Contents area. Then expand the
Measures folder. This folder lists all measures in the subject area. For example:

You can have two types of measures, indicated by icons as follows:

Standard measures

Calculated measures, which are defined in terms of other measures

#### 2.3.2 Dimensions

To display a list of dimensions, select Dimensions from the drop-down list in the Model Contents area. Then expand the
Dimensions folder. This folder lists the dimensions and the levels, members, and properties that they contain; it might also
list related subject areas, with their dimensions, levels, and so on.

Click the triangle next to any dimension name to expand it. A dimension contains at least one level and may also include a special member known as the All member. In the following example, the AgeD dimension includes an All member named All Patients, as well as the levels Age Group, Age Bucket, and Age.

##### 2.3.2.1 Hierarchies

Each dimension also includes at least one hierarchy, which is the actual container for levels. The following shows an example (a modified v ersion of the Patients subject area), with a hierarchy named H1.

`

By default, hierarchy names are not shown unless a dimension contains multiple hierarchies. Alternatively, a dimension can be defined so that its hierarch y names are always or never shown.

In the Patients subject area, each dimension contains only one hierarchy, so the hierarchy names are not shown. Hierarchies
are purely informational; you cannot drag and drop them as you can with the other items in the Model Contents pane.

##### 2.3.2.2 Level Members and Properties

If you expand a level, the list displays the members of that level. For example:

If a level also includes properties, this area shows the property names with a different icon. For example, the City level
includes the Population and Principal Export properties:

Variations for Data Levels with Many Members

If a data level contains more than 500 members but fewer than 10,000 members, this area displays any property names,
followed by subfolders that contain the members in groups of 100. For example:

In this case, the system does not access the member names until you expand one of these subfolders. Thus it is possible to see and use the properties without waiting for the system to access all the member names.

If a level contains 10,000 members or more, this area displays only the property names, if any, of the level.

The preceding discussion applies only to data levels. In contrast, time levels are always displayed in the same way.

##### 2.3.2.3 Related Subject Areas

The Dimensions folder might also list related subject areas, which it shows in bold italics. If you expand a related subject
area, you can access the dimensions, levels, and possibly the hierarchies of the other subject area, as follows:

#### 2.3.3 Pivot Variables

To display a list of pivot variables, select Dimensions from the drop-down list in the Model Contents area. Then expand
the Pivot Variables folder. This folder (if included) lists any pivot variables in the subject area. For example:

Unlike most other elements in the Dimensions section, pivot variables are defined in the Analyzer; see Defining and Using
Pivot Variables.

#### 2.3.4 Plug-ins

To display a list of plug-ins, select Dimensions from the drop-down list in the Model Contents area. Then expand the Plug-
ins folder. This folder (if included) lists any plugins in the subject area. For example:

A plug-in contains one or more properties, each of which computes a value. This particular plug-in contains two properties. Plug-in properties can be used in the same way as measures.

#### 2.3.5 Named Sets

To display a list of named sets, select Dimensions from the drop-down list in the Model Contents area. Then expand the
Named Sets folder. This folder (if included) lists any named sets in the subject area. For example:

A set contains one or more items; typically each item is a member of a level defined else where.

#### 2.3.6 Named Filters

To display a list of named filters, select Dimensions from the drop-down list in the Model Contents area. Then expand the
Named Filters folder. This folder (if included) lists any named filters in the subject area. F or example:

Unlike most other elements in the Dimensions section, named filters are defined in the Analyzer; see Defining Named Filters .

#### 2.3.7 Calculated Members

At the bottom of the Dimensions section, the Model Contents pane shows any special dimensions that contain calculated
members. These special dimensions include only members, not hierarchies or levels. For example:

Calculated members are typically combinations of other members. For example, the Primary Colors member is a combination of the Red, Yellow, and Blue members of the Favorite Color level.

Other dimensions in your model might also include calculated members. If so, the member is displayed in that dimension with a different icon than other members. For example, if we redefined the tw o calculated members to move them to the
ColorD dimension, we would see the following for that dimension:

Unlike most other elements in the Dimensions section, calculated members can be defined in the Analyzer; see Defining
Calculated Elements.

#### 2.3.8 Pivot Tables

To display a list of pivot tables, select Pivots from the drop-down list in the Model Contents area. Then expand the Pivots
folder. This folder (if included) lists any pivot tables defined in the subject area. F or example:

To use this area, expand folders and needed and click a pivot table name. The Pivot Preview area then displays that pivot table.

#### 2.3.9 Quality Measures

To display a list of quality measures, select Quality Measures from the drop-down list in the Model Contents area. Then
expand the Quality Measures folder. This folder (if included) lists any quality measures in the subject area. For example:

Quality measures can be used in the same way as measures.

#### 2.3.10 Detail Listings

To display a list of detail listings, select Detail Listings from the drop-down list in the Model Contents area. This area then
lists any detail listings defined in the subject area. F or example:

For information on using this area, see Displaying a Detail Listing.

### 2.4 Creating a Pivot Table

To create a pivot table:

1. Click New.

2.

In the Model Contents pane, select either Dimensions or Quality Measures.

3. Drag and drop items from the Model Contents pane to the Pivot Builder area, as described in the rest of this page.

For example:

a. Expand DiagD in the Model Contents pane.

b. Drag and drop Diagnoses to Rows.

Or double-click Diagnoses.

Or click Diagnoses and then click the plus sign in the header of the Rows box.

c. Drag and drop Patient Count to Measures.

Or double-click this measure.

Or click Patient Count and then click the plus sign in the header of the Measures box.

d. Drag and drop Avg Allergy Count to Measures.

e. Expand AgeD in the Model Contents pane.

f. Drag and drop All Patients to Rows, below Diagnoses.

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 as necessary.

Each time you make a change, the Analyzer reruns the pivot table and shows the results in the Pivot Preview area. For
the preceding steps, the final result might be as follo ws (depending on the values in your data):

5. Click Save.

The system displays a dialog box where you specify the pivot table name.

6. For Pivot Name, specify the name of the pivot table.

Also see Preparing for Folder Item Localization.

Note that this complete string is used (along with Folder) as the logical name of the pivot table; the system displays
this logical name when you use the Save As option, for example.

7. Optionally specify other values as follows:

- Folder — Type a folder name or select an existing folder.

Also see Preparing for Folder Item Localization.

Note that if you specify a folder name that starts with a single dollar sign, the pivot table definition is accessible only in your IDE.

- Public — Specifies whether this pi vot table is displayed in the User Portal main area.

Important:

This option does not control access to the pivot table. Access is controlled instead by the Pivot Owner and Access Resource options, discussed later in this list.

Note that even if the pivot table is not marked as public, you can access it in the Analyzer via Open. Also, you can find it in the User Portal by using the Find option. See Introduction to the User Portal.

Locked — Select this check box to temporarily prevent changes to this pivot table. If you select this option, you must clear the Locked check box before any changes can be made to it.

Pivot Owner — Optionally specifies the InterSystems IRIS® data platform user who o wns this pivot table. If a
pivot table has an owner, then only the owner can specify the Access Resource value for the pivot table; see the
next item.

Access Resource — Optionally specifies the resource that is used to control access to this pi vot table. If you specify this, also specify Pivot Owner.

See Visibility of Folders and Folder Items.

Description — Type a description for this pivot table.

Keywords — Type keywords to categorize this pivot table, one keyword (or phrase) per line.

These keywords are displayed in the User Portal in List View.

Category — Specify the category to which this item belongs.

Categories control how the items are grouped in the User Portal in Covers View.

- 8. Click OK.

- 2.5 Specifying the Rows in a Pivot Table

- To specify the rows of a pivot table, you drag and drop items of various types from the Model Contents pane into different areas of the Rows box. This section discusses, with samples, the items that can be used as rows, and provides details of how to specify the rows.

- 2.5.1 Items That Can Be Used in the Rows Box

- You can use any combination of the following items in the Rows box:

- Levels. This is the most common scenario. When you drag and drop a level to Rows, the query creates a set of all the
members of that level, and uses those members for rows. For example:

- Rows Allergies level

- Members, including calculated members. You can drag and drop individual members to Rows. For example:

Rows

## 10 to 19 member of Age Bucket level Green member of Favorite Color level

asthma member of Allergies level

Important:

To drag and drop a member, you must click the member name rather than the icon to its left.

Note that you can hide the row caption; see Specifying Pivot Options. This option is especially useful when you drag
and drop individual members, because the name of the first member is also used as the caption for the ro ws, and this is not usually a suitable caption.

- Dimensions, including calculated dimensions. If you drag and drop a dimension to Rows, the query uses all members
of the first le vel of the first hierarch y of that dimension. For example:

Rows

AgeD dimension

- Named sets. If you drag and drop a named set to Rows, the query uses each item in that set as a separate row. For
example:

Rows

Sample Set 2

- Measures. If you drag and drop a measure to Rows, the system uses that measure as a row. For example:

Rows

Avg Age measure Avg Allergy Count measure

Avg Test Score measure

If there is only one column (as in the case shown here), the data shown for the measure is the aggregate value for that measure across all records (or across all included records, if the pivot table is filtered).

If the pivot table includes multiple columns corresponding to members, then the data in any column is the value for that measure for that member.

If the pivot table includes columns that correspond to measures, the column definition tak es precedence and the value shown is determined by the measure used in the column.

Note that you can hide the row caption; see Specifying Pivot Options. This option is especially useful when you drag
and drop measures to Rows, because the name of the first measure is also used as the caption for the ro ws, and this is not usually a suitable caption.

- Level properties. See Displaying Properties in a Pivot Table.

- Pivot variables. See Defining and Using Expression Pi vot Variables.

- Plugins. For example:

Rows

PatientCount plug-in property HighScoreCount plug-in property

- Quality measures.

You can also double-click a level, dimension, member, or named set in the Model Contents pane. If you do, the system removes any items currently in Rows and replaces them with what you double-clicked.

If hierarchies are displayed in the Model Contents pane, they are for informational purposes only; you cannot drag and
drop them.

#### 2.5.2 Specifying the Rows

To specify the rows in the pivot table, drag and drop items from the Model Contents pane to the Drop row here label in the
Rows box. When you do so, the Rows box looks like this:

Now there are three places into which you can drag and drop additional items:

- If you drag and drop onto the bold item label (Age Group in this case), the Analyzer replaces the existing item with the new one.

- If you drag and drop onto Drop row here, the Analyzer adds additional rows to the table. For example:

- Rows

Note that you can hide the row caption; see Specifying Pivot Options.

If you drag and drop onto the Add Breakout button
rows. For example:

after the bold item label, the Analyzer subdivides the existing

Rows

Notice that now there are two labels called Drop row here. The non-indented one affects the outermost grouping. The indented one affects the inner grouping.

When you nest levels this way, the system initially returns only the first 2,000 combinations of the le vels. If there are more than 2,000 rows, the system displays the Show All button at the bottom of the pivot preview area. If you click this button, the system returns all the combinations, and you can page through them.

To remove an item from the rows, click the X button to the right of its label in the Rows box.

For information on the Advanced Options button

, see Customizing Pivot Table Items.

Note:

If you use calculated members for rows, they are always shown after the other members.

### 2.6 Specifying the Columns in a Pivot Table

The columns of a pivot table are controlled by Measures and Columns:

- For the Columns box, you can drag and drop any of the items that you can use for Rows. See the preceding section for information on the items and details on the options.

- You can drag and drop only measures from the Model Contents pane to Measures.

Measures are always used as the innermost grouping. For example, consider the following pivot table configuration:

This pivot table looks as follows:

Note:

The system does not display more than 100 columns.

### 2.7 Displaying Measures in a Pivot Table

By default, the Analyzer displays the count of lowest-level records. For example:

Within the body of the pivot table, you can instead display one or more measures, quality measures, or plug-in properties, in any combination. Note that you can use measures, quality measures, and plug-in properties (usually referred to as plugins) interchangeably. This section uses the generic term measures to refer to all of these items.

To display a measure as a column, drag and drop it into the Measures box or the Columns box. For example:

Measures

Avg Age measure

Avg Test Score measure

Or double-click the measure in the Model Contents pane.

Or drag and drop a measure to the Rows box, as discussed earlier. Note that if you display a measure as a row and another measure as a column, the system displays only the value of the measure that is used as a column.

The following subsections discuss additional topics:

- Pivot tables with one measure

- Pivot tables with multiple measures

- How to control the display of the measure headings

#### 2.7.1 Pivot Tables with One Measure

To display measures as columns, you can drag and drop them to the Measures box or to the Columns box. If the pivot table has multiple measures, the resulting pivot table (and underlying MDX query) is identical with either technique. If the pivot
table has only a single measure, however, the two techniques generate slightly different MDX queries:

Technique

Comments

Drag and drop the measure to the Measures box

The underlying MDX query uses the measure in its filter clause. This means that this pivot table cannot be displayed in a scorecard (on a dashboard).

Drag and drop the measure to the Columns box

The underlying MDX query uses the measure as a column. This pivot table can be displayed in a scorecard.

#### 2.7.2 Pivot Tables with Multiple Measures

If you drag and drop multiple measures to the Measures box, you can specify whether the measures are used as columns

(as in the default case) or as rows. To do so, click the Options button
box; for this discussion, use the options in the section Place measures on. Choose one of the following:

in the Measures box. The system displays a dialog

- Rows — Displays the measures as rows.

- Columns — Displays the measures as columns.

Then click OK.

This option makes it easier to redefine comple x pivot tables, because you can rearrange the Rows box or Columns box and leave the measures alone.

For example, consider the following pivot table definition:

By default, the measures are used as columns (nested within the elements listed in the Columns box), as in the following
example:

If you instead use the option to display the measures as rows, the pivot table looks like this:

This pivot table is equivalent to one defined as follo ws:

#### 2.7.3 Controlling the Display of the Measure Headings

By default, when a pivot table displays a level on columns and displays measures, the pivot table may or may not include
a heading for the measures, as follows:

- If the pivot table has only one measure, the measure name is not shown. For example:

- If the pivot table has multiple measures, the measure names are shown. For example:

You can control this behavior. To do so, click the Options button
box; for this discussion, use the options in the section Display measure headers. Choose one of the following options:

in the Measures box. The system displays a dialog

- If More Than 1 Measure — The system displays the measure name if there is more than one measure, but does not display the name if there is only one measure.

- Always — The system always displays the measure name.

- Never — The system never displays the measure name.

These options apply only when the pivot table also displays another item on columns, as in the examples shown here.

### 2.8 Displaying Properties in a Pivot Table

You can display the properties of a level if you are also using that level as rows or columns. For example, if you display
City as rows, you can display Principal Export as a column by dragging the property to the Columns box:

Transposing a Pivot Table

If you display City as columns, you can display Principal Export as a row:

#### 2.8.1 Displaying Both Properties and Measures

If you display a property as a column and you want to display a measure as another column, you must drag and drop the
measure to Columns rather than to Measures. For example:

### 2.9 Transposing a Pivot Table

You can transpose a pivot table; that is, switch its rows and columns. To do so, click the Transpose button

.

### 2.10 Changing the Order of Items

To change the order of items listed within the Rows, Columns, Measures, or Filters box:

1. Click an item within that box. When you do so, the system enables the applicable buttons in the header of the box.

2. Click the up or down arrows as appropriate.

### 2.11 Copying and Pasting Items

To copy and paste items within the Rows, Columns, Measures, or Filters box:

1. Click an item within that box. Now it is shown with a highlight.

2.

Click the Copy button

in the top area.

3. Click the destination for this item. Either click another box or click an item in a box.

4. Click one of the paste buttons:

- Click

- to paste the item within the box or after to the selected item.

Click

to paste the item as a breakout within the selected item.

### 2.12 Adding a Summary Row or Column

You can add a summary row, summary column, or both. This section describes the following approaches:

- Adding the summary as a pivot option

- Using the All member as a summary

- Using a custom aggregation as a summary

#### 2.12.1 Adding a Summary Row or Column as a Pivot Option

To add a summary row, summary column, or both:

1.

Click the Pivot Options button

.

The Analyzer displays the Pivot Options page, which is discussed in detail later in this book.

This procedure discusses only the Summary option.

2. Click the Summary check box.

3. Select a summary option from the drop-down list. The options are as follows:

- Sum — Displays the sum of the values.

- Count — Displays the count of rows.

- Max — Displays the maximum of the values.

- Min — Displays the minimum of the values.

- Average — Displays the average of the values.

- % of Total — Displays the sum of the values of this column (or row), as a percentage of the sums of all columns (or rows).

For information on overriding how the summary is computed for a given measure, see Specifying Alternative Aggregation Methods for a Measure.

4.

(For summary rows only) Optionally, to cause the summary row to summarize all rows (including rows on later pages), select All Rows from the second drop-down list.

For example, the following pivot table includes a total row. Notice that it displays the total only for numeric values:

The following example shows % of Total, which is useful primarily when you use a level in Columns:

In contrast to the other forms of summaries, note the following:

- If you display the pivot table as a chart, the chart does not include the summary row or column.

- If you export to Excel, the summary is included only if it is a sum.

#### 2.12.2 Adding the All Member as a Summary Row or Column

Your cube may include one or more All members. Each dimension can contain a All member, which is listed within the
dimension, in the Model Contents pane, before any levels. For example:

An All member represents all records and is typically named something like All Ages or All Categories. Or, as in the example shown here, the All member might have a truly generic name.

You can drag and drop this member to Rows or Columns to add it as a summary row or column. For example:

In contrast to using the pivot options, this approach allows each measure to be aggregated in a different manner. The Patient Count measure is summed, and the Avg Age and Avg Allergy Count measures are averaged.

If you do not have any All members, you can add a custom aggregation.

#### 2.12.3 Adding a Summary Row or Column as a Custom Aggregation

This section describes how to add a summary row as a custom aggregation. The technique is easily adapted for a summary column.

1. For the level used as the rows, add the same level again to the Rows box.

2.

next to the second level in Rows.

The Analyzer displays the Advanced Options page, which is discussed in detail later in this book.

3. Select Compute Aggregate and then select an aggregation function. You can use any of the following functions:

- SUM — For each displayed measure, display the sum of the values of the members.

- AVG — For each displayed measure, display the average of the values of the members.

- MIN — For each displayed measure, display the minimum of the values of the members.

- MAX — For each displayed measure, display the maximum of the values of the members.

- COUNT — For each displayed measure, display the count of the members.

- COUNT NONEMPTY — For each displayed measure, display the count of the members that have values in the current context.

- AGGREGATE — For each displayed measure, display the aggregate value of the members, using the aggregation method defined for that measure.

- MEDIAN — For each displayed measure, display the median of the values of the members.

- STDDEV — For each displayed measure, display the standard deviation of the values of the members.

- VARIANCE — For each displayed measure, display the variance of the values of the members.

- PERCENTILE — For the given percentile value and for each displayed measure, display the measure value that is at that percentile value.

For this option, you can specify a percentile value in the Percentile field; the def ault is 50.

4. Optionally type a new caption into Caption. The default caption is the name of the function.

When you use this option, the system first uses an y other settings you specified on this dialog box.

For example, consider the following pivot table:

This pivot table is defined with the follo wing items in Rows:

The second Gender item uses the following options:

- Compute Aggregate is Aggregate

- Caption is Subtotal

### 2.13 Applying 80/20 Suppression

The Analyzer provides an easy way to display the top 80% of a set (considering the count measure by default), and to group the bottom 20% into a single unit, as in the following example.

This example demonstrates the 80/20 suppression option used for rows. The option is also available for columns. To use
this option:

1.

in the Rows or Columns box.

2. Optionally click Sort Members.

Then select a measure and select Ascending or Descending.

By default, the 80/20 suppression option first sorts the members in descending order by count. Use Sort Members to specify a different sort order.

3. Select Apply 80/20 Suppression.

4. Click OK.

To modify the query to use different percentages, see the section Modifying Details of the 80/20 Suppression Option.

### 2.14 Clearing the Autosave State of a Pivot Table

If the autosave feature for the Analyzer is enabled, then when you display a pivot table, the Analyzer displays that pivot table with any unsaved changes that you might have made in the Analyzer. To remove these unsaved changes, click Restore. Then the Analyzer displays the pivot table as defined in its sa ved definition.

Or save the pivot table, thus saving the changes and changing the definition. See the next topic.

### 2.15 Saving a Pivot Table

To save a pivot table, do one of the following:

Saving a Pivot Table

- Click Save. The Analyzer saves the pivot table immediately, if you have specified a name for it; otherwise, the Analyzer
prompts you as if you had selected Menu > Save With Options.

- Click Menu > Save. The Analyzer saves the pivot table immediately, if you have specified a name for it; otherwise,
the Analyzer prompts you as if you had selected Menu > Save With Options.

- Click Menu > Save With Options. The Analyzer displays a dialog box with the same options that are available for a
new pivot table; see Creating a Pivot Table.

If you specify a new folder or a new name, the Analyzer creates a copy of the original pivot table and saves it to this new name.

Then click OK.

If the pivot table already exists, the system prompts you for confirmation that you w ant to overwrite it.

Or click Save As to make a copy of the pivot table. The Analyzer prompts you for a new name.

To check whether or not a pivot table has unsaved changes, check its name in the upper left corner of the Analyzer banner. An asterisk by the pivot table name indicates unsaved changes, and will disappear after saving.

This page describes how to use the Business Intelligence Analyzer to include filters in a pi vot table, which restricts the set of records that the pivot table accesses.

Note:

Applying a filter to a pi vot table is different from adding a filter control to a pi vot table widget in a dashboard (see Creating Dashboards). A filter control enables another user later to filter the data. You can add filter controls to a widget that displays a pivot table that has its own filter .

### 3.1 About Filters

Filters restrict the set of records that the system uses.

Use the Filters box, shown below, to add filters to your pi vot table:

Filters can be either simple or advanced, and you can add any combination of filters to your pi vot table.

To create simple filters, you can also drag and drop filter items to the

filter bar directly above the pivot table:

Later sections describe how to create these filters in detail.

### 3.2 Dragging and Dropping Filter Items

You can drag and drop an individual member to use as a filter . To do so, drag and drop a member to Drop filter here in the Filters box or to the filter bar .

The pivot table is then filtered to sho w only data for that member. The Filters box displays the name of the associated level,
and the filter bar displays the name of the le vel and the member. For example:

### 3.3 Creating and Using a Drop-Down Menu

You can drag and drop a level to the Filters box or the filter bar and then use the filter drop-do wn menu that the system displays. This section provides the details. (You can use expression pivot variables in the same way. See Defining and Using Expression Pivot Variables.)

For example, if you drag and drop the Year level, you might see this in the Analyzer (depending on what else you have
done):

Use the control to select members of the Year level. When you click the Search button

, you see something like this:

Creating and Using a Drop-Down Menu

Here you can:

- Select All to see all members of this level (that is, perform no filtering with this le vel).

- Note that the maximum number of members that can be displayed is 2500.

- Select one or more members to filter the pi vot table to use only data for those members.

- You must press Ctrl while selecting multiple members.

Select one or more members and select Exclude Members to filter the pi vot table to use data for all members except for the selected ones.

Click Range and then specify an inclusive range of members. When you click Range, the control changes to look like
this:

In each drop-down list, select a member. For a time level, the list of members includes NOW, which always refers to the current date.

For other options, see Filtering Data..

When you are done, click the check mark button to accept the selections. Or click the X button to discard your changes.

Note:

The filter control is part of the Pivot Builder area, not part of the Pivot Preview area. This has two implications:

- When you save the pivot table, the Analyzer saves any selections in the filter control. When you next open the pivot table, the Analyzer redisplays the filter control as you sa ved it.

- The pivot table as seen in a dashboard is filtered as you sa ved it and does not include the filter control. (Y ou use a separate mechanism to provide filters to users of your dashboards.)

### 3.4 Adding Advanced Filters

To see the filter definition for an adv
then displays a dialog box with information like the following:

anced filter , click the Advanced Options button

next to that filter . The system

This represents the logic of the filter , but not its literal syntax. This filter selects only products that are either of the follo wing:

- Candy products sold in Bangalore

- Snack products sold in Houston The Advanced Filter Editor enables you to easily add, modify, and remove parts of a filter e xpression, while seeing the resulting expression with every change. This book does not describe this tool in detail, but instead provides a brief demonstration.

1.

in the Filters box. The system displays a dialog box like the following:

2. Click Add Condition.

The dialog box now looks something like this:

Adding Advanced Filters

Initially, the advanced filter editor uses the first le

vel (considering alphabetic order) defined in your subject area.

3.

If you want to use a different level:

a. Click YearSold, which enables you to edit this part of the expression.

b. Optionally type a string into the search box and then click Search. This is useful if the cube has a large number

of levels.

c. Select a level from the drop-down list on the left. As soon as you do, the expression is updated. For example:

The end of the drop-down list may include measures; if so, see Filtering the Data by Measure Value, later in this
page.

4.

If you want to change the operator from IS to IS NOT:

a. Click IS, which enables you to edit this part of the expression.

b.

In the left area, click IS NOT. As soon as you do, the expression is updated.

5. To specify a member of the level:

a. Click <select a value>, which enables you to edit this part of the expression. The left area might look like the fol-

lowing:

b.

In the left area, click the Search button

under Select a value to display a dialog.

c. The resulting dialog displays a set of members and options. Optionally type text into the search box and press

Enter; this restricts the set of members listed in the dialog.

The list of values also includes all searchable measures (see the next section) and all pivot variables (see Defining and Using Pivot Variables).

d. Select members and options by selecting their check boxes.

e. Click the check mark button in the upper right hand corner of the dialog. As soon as you do, the expression is

updated.

For example:

f. Alternatively, you may enter an MDX key by selecting the MDX Key option.

This advanced filter is equi valent to a simple filter . Typically you would now add another condition or a branch that contains other conditions.

6. To add another condition:

a. Click AND, so that you can edit this item.

b. Optionally, in the left area, click OR. As soon as you do, the expression is updated.

c. Click Add condition.

You might now see the following:

d. Edit this condition in the same way that you edited the first one.

7. Click OK to close the dialog box.

Or add another condition or a branch that contains other conditions.

Note that you can undo any change. To do so, click Undo.

### 3.5 Filtering the Base Records by Measure Value

If your subject area includes searchable measures, you can filter records used in a pi vot table by the value of those measures.
To do so:

Filtering the Base Records by Measure Value

1.

in the Filters box.

2. Click Add Condition.

The dialog box now looks something like this:

The advanced filter editor initially uses the first le

vel (considering alphabetic order) defined in your subject area.

3. Click Age Group, which allows you to edit this part of the expression.

4. Click the drop-down list on the left and scroll to the end of the list, which may include measures. For example:

Note that the list of values also includes all pivot variables (see Defining and Using Pi vot Variables).

5. Click the measure that you want to use.

Now the expression is updated as follows:

6. Click the operator, which is an equals sign (=) by default.

Now the editor displays the following set of operators:

Or, if the searchable measure contains string values, the editor displays the following operators: = <> LIKE

7. Click the comparison value, which is 0 by default.

Now the editor displays a box into which you can type a new value.

8. Type a value and then click Apply.

If you enter a string value, enclose it within single quotes. For example: 'abc'

9. Click OK to close the dialog box.

Or add another condition or a branch that contains other conditions.

For example, consider the following filter:

This filter selects all patients whose test score is 65 or higher .

### 3.6 Defining Named Filters

A named filter is sa ved with the subject area. You can use it in multiple pivot tables and in filter controls on dashboards.

To define a named filter:

1. Make sure that no named filter is currently selected.

2.

Click the Named Filter button

in the Model Contents pane.

3. For Filter Name, type a user-friendly filter name.

4. For Description, type an optional description.

The rest of the dialog box is the same as the Advanced Filter Editor.

5. For details on the rest of this dialog box, see Adding Advanced Filters, earlier in this page.

When you are done, the Model Contents pane displays the filter within the Named Filters section.

Redefining a Named Filter

Because a named filter can be relati vely complex, it can be useful to define appropriate named filters for use on dashboards. If you do this, users of the dashboards can filter their data more easily .

### 3.7 Redefining a Named Filter

To redefine a named filter:

1. Select the named filter in the Model Contents pane.

2.

Click the Named Filter button

.

3. Make changes as needed.

For details, see Adding Advanced Filters, earlier in this page.

### 3.8 Deleting a Named Filter

To delete a named filter:

1. Select the named filter in the Model Contents pane.

2. Click the X button.

3. Click OK to confirm this deletion.

### 3.9 Using Named Filters

To use a named filter , drag and drop it from the Model Contents pane to the Filters box.

Or double-click the named filter; then it is added to the Filters box.

### 3.10 Disabling or Removing Filters

To disable a filter , clear the check box to the left of the name of the filter in the Filters box.

To remove a filter , click the X to the right of the name of the filter .

### 3.11 How Business Intelligence Combines Filters

This section describes how the system combines filters.

If you apply multiple simple filters, the system combines them as follo ws (but see the important note after this list):

- The system uses a logical AND to combine all the items shown in the bar above the pivot table.

Filter

Meaning

All patients whose favorite color is green and whose favorite color is blue (zero patients)

All patients who are allergic to both mold and to pollen

All patients whose favorite color is green and who are allergic to ant bites

- If this bar displays a level, and if you have selected one or more members of that level in the drop-down, those members are combined with a logical OR.

Filter

Meaning

All patients whose favorite color is either green or blue

Finding the Key for a Member

All patients who are allergic to mold, to pollen, or to both

All patients whose favorite color is green or blue and who also are allergic to ant bites

If you have also applied advanced filters, those are combined with the other filters via logical AND.

Important:

Depending on the form of the combined filter , the system might perform axis folding. This phrase refers to the process of combining multiple filters (a filter is considered to be a query axis). Axis folding means that if a given source record has a non-null result for each slicer axis, that record is counted multiple times. For details on when this occurs, see Axis Folding in How the Business Intelligence Query Engine Works.

### 3.12 Finding the Key for a Member

This section describes how and why to find the k ey identifier for a member .

Each member has two identifiers:

- A name (shown in the Analyzer and pivot tables). For example, in the Patients sample, a member of the Doctor level might have the name Vivaldi, Lola

- Names are not necessarily unique.

A key (never displayed). This is often but not always the same as the name. For example, in the Patients sample, the doctor whose name is Vivaldi, Lola might have the key 12

The keys should be unique in a well-defined cube. (The system does not force them to be unique, b ut the developers who create a cube can and should take steps to ensure their uniqueness.)

When you create a filter by drag and drop actions, the system automatically uses the member k ey rather than the member name.

You should use the key when you specify a filter v alue manually, which you do in the following scenarios:

- When you specify the default value for a filter control on a dashboard (as described in Creating Dashboards).

- When you specify the initial value for a filter control via a dashboard URL (as described in Implementing InterSystems

Business Intelligence).

It is also best practice to use the key when you refer to a member in a pivot variable.

To find the k ey for a given member, do the following:

1. Drag and drop the member to the Filters box in the Analyzer.

2.

Click the Display Query button

on the toolbar.

The system displays the current MDX query, which looks something like this:

The %FILTER part specifies the filter for this member. The key for this member is 32.

. The [DocD].[H1].[Doctor].&[32] part is the complete member identifier

If the level contains multiple members with the same name, and if you are not sure which member to use, try the following
technique:

1. Drag and drop each of the members to Rows.

2.

If this level has a property, drag and drop that to Columns. The property values are typically different for each member, and you can use the information here to determine which member to look at.

Or drag and drop a level to Columns. Choose a level that can give some context.

In other cases, it might be necessary to display a detail listing in order to correctly identify the desired member.

This page describes how to define calculated elements in Business Intelligence.

These calculated elements can be saved as part of a pivot table definition (and are then usable only in that pi vot table) or can be saved in a shared area (and are then usable in any pivot table based on the same cube).

### 4.1 Overview

Often it is convenient to combine existing model elements into new elements. In InterSystems IRIS Business Intelligence,
you can add two kinds of calculated elements:

- You can define a ne w measure that is based on other measures. For example, you can define a measure via a formula
like the following:

- Measure 3 = (Measure 1 + Measure 2) / Measure 2) This is not the exact syntax. The following sections provide more detail.

You can define a ne w member that is based on other members. For example, you could create a Primary Colors member that combines the red, yellow, and blue members of the Favorite Color dimension.

The new Primary Colors member refers to all the patients who belong to the red, yellow, or blue members.

In MDX, a measure is considered to be a member, and both kinds of calculated elements are considered to be calculated members. This book uses the phrase calculated measure to refer to a calculated member that is a measure.

### 4.2 Defining a Calculated Measure

To define a measure that is based on other measures:

If you intend to define this measure only in a gi ven pivot table, save that pivot table.

1.

2.

.

The system displays the following dialog box (partially shown here):

3. For Member Type, click Measure.

When you do so, the system automatically selects Measures for the Dimension option.

4. Optionally select Shared Storage. The system uses this option as follows:

- If Shared Storage is not selected, the calculated measure is stored with the pivot table definition and can be used in this pivot table but nowhere else.

- If Shared Storage is selected, the calculated measure is stored in a shared area and can be used in any pivot table based on the same cube. In this case, the Analyzer displays the calculated measure along with the elements that are defined in the cube itself.

5. For Member name, type the name of the new measure.

6. Specify the MDX expression that defines the ne w member. To do so, you can do either of the following:

- Type the expression directly into Expression.

- Use the Expression Builder. This tool is intended to make it easy to obtain the correct MDX identifier for an y part of the cube. To access this tool, click the magnifying glass next to Expression. The left area lists the contents of the cube, including all measures and levels. The right area displays the expression that you are creating. To add an item to the expression, drag and drop it from the left area to the expression. The item is added to the end of the expression, and you might need to move it to a different part of the expression.

For an introduction to these expressions, see the first subsection .

7. Optionally specify the following additional options:

- Format — Specify a format string to control how this measure is displayed. See Specifying a Format String.

- Solve Order — Use this if your pivot table has a calculated measure as a column and a conflicting calculated measure (or other kind of calculated member) as a row. See the second subsection.

8. Click OK.

The new member is then displayed within the Measures section in the Model Contents pane:

Defining a Calculated Measure

You can then use this measure in the same way you use any other measure.

#### 4.2.1 Measure Expressions

The measure expression can include the following elements:

- References to measures. The syntax is as follows:

[MEASURES].[measure name]

Or:

MEASURES.[measure name]

You can omit the square brackets around the measure name, if the measure name contains only alphanumeric characters,
does not start with a number, and is not an MDX reserved word. (MDX statements and functions are reserved words;
see the table of contents in the InterSystems MDX Reference.)

The expression is not case-sensitive.

Numeric literals. For example: 37

Pivot variables. See Defining and Using Pi vot Variables.

- To refer to a pivot variable, use the syntax $variable.variablename where variablename is the logical variable
name. This syntax is not case-sensitive.

- Mathematical operators. Business Intelligence supports the standard mathematical operators: + (addition), - (subtraction), / (division), and * (multiplication). It also supports the standard unary operators: + (positive) and - (negative).

For example: MEASURES.[%COUNT] / 100

You can also use parentheses to control precedence.

- MDX functions that return numeric values. Many MDX functions return numeric values, including AVG, MAX, COUNT, and others. See the InterSystems MDX Reference for details.

For other variations and specific recipes, see Defining Calculated Members .

#### 4.2.2 Solve Order

The Solve Order option is useful if your pivot table has a calculated member (either measure or non-measure) as a column and a conflicting calculated member as a ro w.

This option affects how the system determines the value in the cell and the format applied to the cell. By default:

- The column determines the Format.

- If both calculated members are measures, the column determines the cell value. (In other scenarios, the logic is more complex and Solve Order does not apply.) If you instead want the row to determine the format and the value, ensure that Solve Order is higher for the calculated member used as a row.

With one exception, the calculated member with the higher Solve Order is evaluated last and thus controls the results. The exception is that if a row or column uses the %CELL function, its implicit default Solve Order is 10.

If the row and column both use %CELL and you want the row to determine the value and format string, set the Solve Order to 11 for the row.

If the column and row members have the same Solve Order, the column member controls the results, as in the default case.

Tip:

For calculated measures that depend on other calculated measures, the system recognizes the dependencies and evaluates the measures in the appropriate order. You do not need to use Solve Order for these measures.

### 4.3 Defining a Calculated Member That Is Not a Measure

To define a calculated member based on other members:

If you intend to define this member only in a gi ven pivot table, save that pivot table.

1.

2.

.

3. For Member Type, click Dimension.

4. Optionally select Shared Storage. The system uses this option as follows:

- If Shared Storage is not selected, the calculated measure is stored with the pivot table definition and can be used in this pivot table but nowhere else.

- If Shared Storage is selected, the calculated measure is stored in a shared area and can be used in any pivot table based on the same cube. In this case, the Analyzer displays the calculated measure along with the elements that are defined in the cube itself.

5. For Dimension, either select a dimension or type the name of a new dimension. For example: Calculated

You can specify any dimension, including an existing dimension that includes non-calculated members or a new dimension.

6. For Member, type the name of the new member.

7. Specify the MDX expression that defines the ne w member. To do so, you can do any of the following:

- Select a level from Dimension level. You can choose any level from the dimension that you selected in step 3. Then use Existing members to select one or more members of that level.

Defining a Calculated Member That Is Not a Measure

- The system then creates an MDX set expression in the Expression field.

- Then edit the expression in the Expression field.

Type the expression directly into Expression.

Use the Expression Builder. This tool is intended to make it easy to obtain the correct MDX identifier for an y part of the cube. To access this tool, click the magnifying glass next to Expression. The left area lists the contents of the cube, including all measures and levels. The right area displays the expression that you are creating. To add an item to the expression, drag and drop it from the left area to the expression. The item is added to the end of the expression, and you might need to move it to a different part of the expression.

These expressions are discussed later in this section.

8. Optionally specify the following additional options:

- Format — Specify a format string to control how numeric values are displayed for this member. See Specifying a Format String.

- Solve Order — Select a number to specify the relative order in which to evaluate this calculated member, compared to other calculated members that affect the same cell. See Solve Order, earlier in this page.

9. Click OK.

The new member is then available in the Dimensions section in the Model Contents pane:

If you added the member to an existing dimension, the system lists it within every level of that dimension. If you added it to a new dimension, that new dimension is displayed at the bottom of this pane. For example, the following shows a new
dimension with two calculated members:

You can then use these members the same way that you use other members.

In a typical case, you define a ne w member that combines other members. In these cases, use one of the following syntaxes:

- If the members that you want to combine all belong to the same level, use the %OR function as follows:

%OR({member reference, member reference, ...})

For example:

%OR({[colord].[h1].[favorite color].[red],
[colord].[h1].[favorite color].[blue],
[colord].[h1].[favorite color].[yellow]})

The general syntax for a member reference is as follows:

[dimension name].[hierarchy name].[level name].[member name]

Or:

[dimension name].[hierarchy name].[level name].&[member key]

- As a special case of the preceding, you can define a member that combines a range of members of a time le vel. To do so, use the %TIMERANGE function, which enables you to define an open-ended range. F or example, the following
expression defines a range that starts after the 2009 member:

%TIMERANGE(DateOfSale.YearSold.&[2009],,EXCLUSIVE)

- Otherwise, use the AGGREGATE function as follows:

AGGREGATE({member reference, member reference, ...})

For other variations and specific recipes, see Defining Calculated Members .

### 4.4 Redefining a Calculated Member

To redefine a calculated member:

1. Select the calculated member in the Model Contents pane.

2.

.

3. Make changes as needed.

### 4.5 Deleting a Calculated Member

To delete a calculated member:

1. Select the calculated member in the Model Contents pane.

2. Click the X button.

3. Click OK to confirm this deletion.

This page describes how to define pi vot variables and use them in Business Intelligence pivot tables.

A pivot variable is saved with the subject area. You can use it in multiple pivot tables and in controls on dashboards.

### 5.1 Overview

Pivot variables provide another way for your end users to interact with your dashboards.

The definition of a pi vot variable includes the following elements:

- A name, which is not case-sensitive.

- A default value, for use when the user has not specified a v alue for the variable.

- (In most cases) A set of allowed values for the user to choose from.

These values are generally MDX identifiers, MDX e xpressions, or literal numbers or strings, depending on precisely how the variable is intended to be used.

Pivot variables are generally intended to be used in pivot tables. Specifically , when you create a pivot table, you can use pivot variables in selected parts of the query that defines the pi vot table. When a dashboard displays the pivot table, that dashboard can include a pivot variable control, with which the user can change the value of the corresponding pivot variable. The system simply substitutes the given value into the query, executes the query, and then redisplays the pivot table.

Similarly, when you access a dashboard via a URL, that URL can include parameters that specify the value for pivot variables used in pivot tables on the dashboard. Before displaying the dashboard, the system substitutes the given value into the queries and executes the queries.

### 5.2 Defining a Pivot Variable

In general, to define a pi vot variable:

1.

Click the Add Pivot Variable button

.

The system displays the following dialog box (partially shown here):

2. For Variable Name, type the logical name of the variable, to be used internally.

The logical name must contain only alphanumeric characters. The name is not case-sensitive; you cannot create multiple
pivot variables whose names differ only in case.

3. Optionally specify the following additional options:

- Caption — Specify the display name of the variable. The default caption is the logical name.

- Description — Specify a description.

- Default Value — Specify the default value. The best practice is to specify a default value so that the system has a valid MDX query for any pivot table that uses this variable.

- For information on the kinds of values to provide, see Expression Pivot Variables and Literal Pivot Variables, later in this page.

How is this variable used — This option affects how the system handles the variable internally. Select one of the
following:

–

–

Expression — Select this if you intend to use this variable to represent an MDX expression.

Literal — Select this if you intend to use this variable to represent a literal number or string, for use within an MDX expression.

For details, see Expression Pivot Variables and Literal Pivot Variables, later in this page.

- What type of value will this variable have — This option affects the default style of the control used when you add a pivot variable control to a dashboard.

- Source of values for this variable — Specify the source of possible values for this pivot variable. Select one of the
following:

– Manual — Select this if you want to provide a hardcoded list of values, if you want to display a calendar

control, or if you want the user to type a value.

If you select Manual, do one of the following:

- To specify a hardcoded list of values, specify Values and (optionally) Captions. For Values, specify one value per line. For Captions, specify the corresponding captions, if any, with one caption per line. In this case, the pivot variable control displays your list of options.

- To display a calendar control, select day for What type of value will this variable have. In this case, the pivot variable control is a calendar control.

- To enable the user to type a value, do not specify Values or Captions. Also, for What type of value will this variable have, do not select day. In this case, the pivot variable control is a simple field into which the user can type a value.

–

–

Termlist — Select this to use a term list to provide the values. If you select this, click the Search button and then select a term list. For each item in the term list, the system uses the item value as the value and uses the item key as the corresponding caption. The pivot variable control displays your list of options.

KPI — Select this to use a KPI to provide the values. If you select this, click the Search button select a KPI.

and then

The KPI should have a property called Value. For each series in the KPI, the system uses the Value property as the value and uses the series name as the corresponding caption. The pivot variable control displays your list of options.

In all cases, for information on the kinds of values to provide, see Expression Pivot Variables and Literal Pivot Variables, later in this page.

4. Click OK.

The new variable is then displayed within the Pivot Variables section in the Model Contents pane.

### 5.3 Defining and Using an Expression Pivot Variable

An expression pivot variable represents an MDX expression.

#### 5.3.1 Defining an Expression Pivot Variable

To define an e xpression pivot variable:

- For How is this variable used, select Expression.

- For Default Value, specify an MDX expression.

- For Source of values for this variable, either specify a hardcoded set of MDX expressions or select a term list or KPI that returns a set of MDX expressions. See the next subsection.

#### 5.3.2 Values for Expression Pivot Variables

A value for an expression pivot variable should be an expression of one of the following types:

Expression
Type

member reference

tuple expression (which represents an AND of multiple members)

set expression (which represents an OR of multiple members)

Examples

[aged].[h1].[age group].&[0 to 29]

See the comments after this table.

([aged].[h1].[age group].&[0 to 29],[gend].[h1].[gender].&[female])

Notice that the member references are separated by commas, and the expression is enclosed in parentheses.

{[homed].[h1].[city].&[magnolia],[homed].[h1].[city].&[pine]}

Notice that the member references are separated by commas, and the expression is enclosed in curly braces.

The general syntax for a member reference is as follows:

[dimension name].[hierarchy name].[level name].[member name]

Or:

[dimension name].[hierarchy name].[level name].&[member key]

You can omit the square brackets for any identifier that contains only alphanumeric characters and that does not start with a number. Also, you can omit the hierarchy and level names if the member name or key is unique within this dimension.

#### 5.3.3 Using an Expression Pivot Variable

To use an expression pivot variable in a pivot table, drag and drop the variable into Rows, Columns, or Filters, as applicable. In each case, the Analyzer adds a control to the filter bar so that you can test the variable. See the example.

Or define a calculated member that uses the pi vot variable. See Defining Calculated Elements .

Note:

If the Analyzer encounters an error parsing a query involving a pivot variable, full details are available in the Business Intelligence Logs for debugging purposes.

#### 5.3.4 Example

The following shows the definition of an e xpression pivot variable:

If we create a new pivot table and then drag and drop this variable to the Rows box, the Analyzer then displays the following
simple pivot table:

To test the pivot variable, we can use the filter bar . If we click the search button for SampleExprVariable, the Analyzer
displays the possible values for this variable:

If we select a different value, the pivot table changes, for example:

### 5.4 Literal Pivot Variables

A literal pivot variable represents a literal string or numeric value to be used within an MDX expression. Depending on how you define a literal pi vot variable, you can use it within the Advanced Filter Editor, in calculated members, or in manually written MDX queries.

#### 5.4.1 Defining a Literal Pivot Variable

To define a literal pi vot variable:

- For How is this variable used, select Literal.

- For Default Value, specify a fragment suitable for use in an MDX query.

- For Source of values for this variable, either specify a hardcoded set of values or select a term list or KPI that returns a set of values. See the next subsection.

#### 5.4.2 Values for Literal Pivot Variables

A literal pivot variable has a literal string or numeric value.

In the most useful scenario, the variable is intended to represent the last part of a member identifier , and you use it in the Advanced Filter Editor. In this scenario, any value for the variable should be a string of the form &[key] where key is a member key. For example: &[0 to 29]. (See Finding the Key for a Member.) See the example later in this section.

In another useful scenario, the variable is intended to represent a number that is used as a multiplier or other formula element. In this case, you would use the variable within the definition of a calculated measure.

#### 5.4.3 Using a Literal Pivot Variable

To use a literal pivot variable in a pivot table, use the Advanced Filter Editor. When you add a condition, select a level.
For the value for that level, select the name of the literal pivot variable; see the example in the next section.

Alternatively, define a calculated member that uses the pi vot variable. See Defining Calculated Elements .

Note:

If the Analyzer encounters an error parsing a query involving a pivot variable, full details are available in the Business Intelligence Logs for debugging purposes.

#### 5.4.4 Example

The following shows the definition of a literal pi vot variable (for use with the HoleFoods sample):

Literal Pivot Variables

Suppose that we create a new pivot table. For this pivot table, we use the Advanced Filter Editor and add a condition. For
this condition, we select the YearSold level. For the Start Time value, we can select the following items:

The item $variable.SampleLitVariable is the pivot variable. The other items are the members of the YearSold
level.

Note that all the pivot variables are available in all the value drop-downs in the Advanced Filter Editor. The
$variable.SampleLitVariable variable is suitable for use only with one level in this case — the YearSold level,
because this is the only level that has members with the keys 2008, 2009, and so on.

### 5.5 Redefining a Pivot Variable

To redefine a pi vot variable:

1. Select the pivot variable in the Model Contents pane.

2.

Click the Pivot Variable button

.

3. Make changes as needed.

### 5.6 Deleting a Pivot Variable

To delete a pivot variable:

1. Select the pivot variable in the Model Contents pane.

2. Click the X button.

3. Click OK to confirm this deletion.

This page describes how to further customize Business Intelligence pivot tables.

### 6.1 Specifying Pivot Options

The Pivot Options dialog box provides many ways to customize the pivot table. To access this dialog box, click the Pivot

Options button

. The Analyzer displays the following:

Here you can do the following:

- Format the pivot table with zebra stripes. If you select Zebra Striping, the table is formatted with rows in alternating
colors as follows:

- Remove the captions for the rows. To do so, clear Row Caption.

- Specify which listing to use for this pivot table. To do so, select a listing from the Listing drop-down menu.

- Specify the maximum number of records to include in listings for this pivot table. To do so, specify a value for Maximum Listing Rows. The default is 1000.

- Apply custom colors and font styles. To do so, use the drop-downs in Row Options, Column Options, or Cell Options.
For example:

This style definition specifies that the font is in 12 pt, blue Verdana on a pale green background. The text is also bold and center-aligned.

If you specify a custom color for the cell background in Cell Options, the system ignores the Zebra Striping option.

- Use the Span Labels options to control whether labels are spanned.

When you display the table in a nested format, the labels are spanned by default. For example:

You can instead repeat the relevant labels, as follows:

- Use the Show Empty options to control whether empty rows and columns are displayed.

- Control the size of the data cells. To do so, type the width in pixels into Width and the height in pixels into Height.

As you make changes, the Preview area is updated to demonstrate the changes. For example:

Customizing Pivot Table Items

If you have enabled the %SQLRESTRICT dimension for a cube, you will see the SQL Restriction field. If you wish to apply an SQL Restriction for the current pivot table, enter a valid SQL SELECT statement or WHERE clause. For more information, see %FILTER Clause.

### 6.2 Customizing Pivot Table Items

The Analyzer displays an Advanced Options button those boxes. The same button is also available for the Rows and Columns boxes.

in the Rows, Columns, and Measures boxes, next to each item in

For example:

If you click any of these buttons, you see the following dialog box—depicted here with only its top part—or a variation of it (the details are different for measures).

The following sections describe changes you can make.

You can specify formatting in multiple places. If you specify different formatting, the following rules control which formatting
options are used:

- Wherever possible, all the formatting is used. For example, if you specify the typeface to use for rows and the color to use for columns, both format options are applied.

- Formatting specified for a measure in a pi vot table takes precedence over formatting specified else where.

- Formatting specified for columns tak es precedence over formatting specified for ro ws or the entire pivot table.

- Formatting specified for ro ws takes precedence over formatting specified for the entire pi vot table.

- Formatting specified in the pi vot table takes precedence over formatting specified in a measure definition (other model elements do not have format options).

### 6.3 Displaying a Constant Row or Column

You can display a constant value rather than the selected item. To do so:

Specifying a Spacer Row or Column

1.

next to the item.

2. Click Value.

3. Type a value into Value. For example:

4. Click OK.

You might also want to specify a different caption; see Specifying New Captions, later in this page.

### 6.4 Specifying a Spacer Row or Column

You can display a spacer row or column rather than the selected item or items. To do so:

1.

next to the item.

2. Click Space.

3. Click OK.

The following shows an example:

For this pivot table, the Rows definition is as follo ws:

### 6.5 Displaying an Different Set for Rows or Columns

You can display an alternative set of elements rather than the selected item or items. To do so:

1.

next to the item.

2. Click Advanced.

3. Type an MDX set expression into MDX Expression.

For information, see Using InterSystems MDX.

4. Click OK.

### 6.6 Specifying New Captions

To specify new captions:

1.

next to the item or in the header of the Rows or Columns box, as appropriate.

2. Type a value into Caption.

To include the original name in the caption, use an asterisk (*) at the appropriate position.

3. Click OK.

For example:

In this case, Caption is Group: *

### 6.7 Specifying a Format String

A format string controls how numbers are displayed and can also specify colors to use. To specify the format string for an
item:

1.

2.

next to the item or in the header of the Rows or Columns box, as appropriate.

Click the Find button

next to Format.

The system displays a dialog box that includes the following fields:

Specifying a Format String

Here:

- Positive piece specifies the format to use for positi ve values.

- Negative piece specifies the format to use for ne gative values.

- Zero piece specifies the format to use for zero.

- Missing piece specifies the format to use for missing v alues.

In each of these, Format string specifies the numeric format, and Color specifies the color .

3. Specify values as needed (see the details after these steps).

4. Click OK.

#### 6.7.1 Format String Field

The Format string field is a string that includes one of the follo wing base units:

Base Unit

Meaning

#

#,#

#.##

Display the value without the thousands separator. Do not include any decimal places.

Display the value with the thousands separator. Do not include any decimal places. This is the default display format for positive numbers.

Display the value without the thousands separator. Include two decimal places (or one decimal place for each pound sign after the period). Specify as many pound signs after the period as you need.

Example

12345

12,345

12345.67

#,#.##

Display the value with the thousands separator. Include two decimal places (or one decimal place for each pound sign after the period). Specify as many pound signs after the period as you need.

12,345.67

You can include additional characters before or after the base unit.

- If you include a percent sign (%), the system displays the value as a percentage. That is, it multiplies the value by 100 and it displays the percent sign (%) in the position you specify.

- Any other characters are displayed as given, in the position you specify.

The following table shows some examples:

Example formatString

Logical Value

Display Value

formatString="#,#;(#,#);"
Note that this corresponds to the default way in which numbers are displayed.

6608.9431

6,609

(1,234)

formatString="#,#.###;"

formatString="#%;"

formatString="$#,#;($#,#);"

#### 6.7.2 Color Piece

For the Color field, specify either of the follo wing:

6608.9431

6,608.943

600%

2195765

$2,195,765

–3407228

- A CSS color name such as MediumBlue or SeaGreen. You can find these at https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/ and other locations on the Internet.

- A hex color code such as #FF0000 (which is red).

- An RGB value such as rgb(255,0,0) (which is red).

### 6.8 Specifying Cell and Header Styles

To specify the cell and header styles for an item:

1.

next to the item or in the header of the Rows or Columns box, as appropriate.

2. Select values in the Cell Style and Header Style groups. These enable you to specify the style of the cells and the

headers, respectively:

Sorting and Filtering Members

To use these options, click each drop-down and select a value. For example:

This style definition specifies that the header is in 12 pt, blue Verdana on a pale green background. The header is also bold and center-aligned.

3. Click OK.

### 6.9 Sorting and Filtering Members

You can filter and sort the members of a le vel or named set in various ways. To do so:

1.

appropriate.

next to a level or named set or in the header of the Rows or Columns box, as

2. Specify the following options as needed:

- Filter members — Select this to filter the members by a measure v alue. Then select a measure and a comparison operator and type a value.

- Sort members — Select this to sort the members. Then select the measure by which to sort them. Click Ascending or Descending to control how the members are sorted.

- Return the first n members — Select this to select a subset from the beginning of the set. Then type an integer into
Count.

When you use this option, the system first uses an y settings you specified for the Filter members and Sort members options.

3. Click OK.

### 6.10 Specifying Alternative Aggregation Methods for a Measure

For any cell in a pivot table, each measure is aggregated from the lowest-level data. Aggregation methods include sum, average, maximum value, and others. By default, the system uses the aggregation method specified in the measure definition. You can specify an alternative method.

Similarly, if you add a summary row or column, you specify how to aggregate the displayed values into a single number for that summary row or column. You can specify an alternative method for this as well.

To specify alternative aggregation methods for a measure:

1.

next to the measure.

2. Specify either or both of the following options:

- Measure Aggregate specifies ho w this measure is aggregated from a set of values in your data.

- The choices are SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, and COUNT.

Total Override specifies ho w the displayed measure values are aggregated for any summary rows or columns.

The choices are Sum, Count, Min, Max, Average, % of Total, and None.

3. Click OK.

See also Adding a Summary Row or Column.

### 6.11 Customizing Double-Click Drilldown

By default, when you double-click a row in a pivot table, the system drills down to the next lowest level in the hierarchy,
if any (see Drilldown via Double-Click). You can customize this behavior. To do so:

1.

in the header of the Rows box.

2. Expand the Drilldown Options group if that is collapsed.

3. For Drilldown Expression, specify one or more MDX set expressions, one per line. For example:

colord.h1.[favorite color].members gend.h1.gender.members

To specify MDX set expressions, you can do either of the following:

- Type the expression directly into Drilldown Expression. Use a line return to establish required line breaks between items.

- Use the Expression Builder. To access this tool, click the plus sign next to Drilldown Expression. The left area lists the contents of the cube, including all measures and levels. The right area displays the expression that you are creating. To add an item to the expression, drag and drop it from the left area to the expression. The item is added to the end of the expression, and you might need to move it to a different part of the expression.

Click the plus sign each time you add an item to the expression. Using the plus sign (rather than a line return) causes the Expression Builder to establish and preserve the required line breaks between items.

Typically you use set expressions of the form [dimension].[hierarchy].[level].MEMBERS, where dimension is the logical name of a dimension, hierarchy is the logical name of a hierarchy, and level is the logical name of a level. This expression represents the members of the given level.

If these identifiers do not include spaces, you can omit the square brack ets. Also, the expression is not case-sensitive.

The first set e xpression controls what happens when the user double-clicks the first time. Specifically , when the user double-clicks the first time, the system creates a ne w query that uses this set expression for rows and that is filtered to the given context.

Similarly, the second expression controls what happens when the user double-clicks the second time, and so on.

The Drilldown Expression option overrides any other drilldown behavior in this pivot table. That is, if a level is in a hierarchy, the hierarchy drilldown behavior does not occur for this pivot table.

4. Click OK.

Disable drilldown: If you wish at any time to disable (but preserve) this drilldown expression, select the Disable drilldown check box. Click OK. This prevents use of the drilldown expression when you double-click a row in this pivot table. It also prevents modification of the drilldo wn expression. To re-activate the drilldown expression, clear the Disable drilldown check box.

For a Drilldown Expression example, see Custom Double-Click Drilldown.

Note:

The same option is available in the Advanced Options button

in the header of the Columns box. This option

is ignored by default but is used if you pivot the table (via the Transpose button click drilldown.

) and then perform double-

### 6.12 Applying Conditional Formatting

You can apply conditional formatting, which can add color, text, or graphics to pivot table cells. To do so, you create rules that examine the values in the cells. This conditional formatting overrides any customization you added to the pivot table.

To do so, click the Conditional Formatting button
(in this example, one rule has been specified):

in the toolbar. The system displays a dialog box like the following

Here, you can do the following:

- Clear all conditional formatting. To do so, click Clear rules.

- Apply an overall color, based on values in the cells. To do so, click a button in the section Color all cells proportionally according to value. See Applying an Overall Color.

- Define a custom gradient for use with the option Color all cells proportionally according to value. To define a custom gradient, use the two buttons displayed below My Colors. Click the first one and select a color to use at the bottom of the range. Click the second one and select a color to use at the top of the range. When you are done, the dialog box
displays your gradient next to the predefined gradients. F or example:

- Create formatting rules. See Adding a Rule.

- Change the order of the rules. To do so, click the up or down arrows in the row for a rule.

- Delete a rule. To do so, click the X button in the row for that rule.

- Reconfigure a rule. To do so, click the Reconfigure b utton

- in the row for that rule.

- Apply the existing rules while leaving this dialog box open. To do so, click Apply.

- Apply the existing rules and exit this dialog box. To do so, click OK.

Close this dialog box without making changes. To do so, click Cancel.

Rules are applied in the same order that they are listed here. If a later rule contains formatting information that is inconsistent with an earlier rule, the system uses the formatting specified in the later rule.

#### 6.12.1 Applying an Overall Color

If you click a button in the section Color all cells proportionally according to value, the cells are colored according to their values. This works as follows: Each button displays a gradient of colors. To assign a color to a cell, the system examines the range of values of the cells. If a value is at the bottom of this range, the system uses the color that is shown at the top of the gradient button (a dark blue in the following example). If a value is at the top of this range, the system uses the color that is shown at the bottom of the gradient button (a light blue in the following example). For other values, the system uses
an intermediate color. The following shows an example:

#### 6.12.2 Adding a Rule

To add a rule, click the plus sign button. The system displays a dialog box where you can specify the rule details (in this
example, one rule has been specified):

Here you can do the following:

- Specify the numeric comparison for the rule to use. A rule compares the value in each cell (or in specific cells) to a
constant, using an operator. For example:

cell_value > 50

For each cell where this rule is true, the rule is applied. All the display details of the rule are applied to that cell.

To specify the numeric comparison, do the following:

1. Select an operator from the first drop-do wn menu.

2. Type a numeric constant into the field to the right of that.

- Optionally specify which row, which column, or both the rule applies to. To do so, type a number into Row #, Col #, or both.

- Optionally specify the text color to use when the rule is true. To do so, click a button in the Color section. If you select the left-most button, the system uses the default color.

- Optionally specify the background color to use when the rule is true. To do so, click a button in the Background Color section. If you select the left-most button, the system uses the default color.

- Optionally specify replacement text to display when the rule is true, instead of the actual cell value. To do so, type text into Replace cell contents with.

- Optionally specify an icon to display when the rule is true, instead of the actual cell value. To do so, click a button in Display icon in cell. This area lists the system icons, followed by any custom icons defined by the implementers. (F or information on adding icons that can be used here, see Creating Icons.) If you select the left-most button, the system does not display an icon.

To display multiple icons, click a number from the Number of icons to display list.

The bottom of the dialog box shows a preview of the formatting.

### 6.13 Specifying the Print Settings

To specify the print options for a given pivot table:

1. Display that pivot table in the Analyzer.

2.

Click the Print Options button

.

3. Click Page Setup.

4. Specify options as described in Customizing Print Settings for a Widget.

5. Click OK.

6. Save the pivot table.

For comments on printing, see Printing Pivot Tables.

Note that when you create dashboards, you can specify print settings in the dashboards as well. See Customizing Print Settings for a Widget.

Specifying the MDX Query Manually

### 6.14 Specifying the MDX Query Manually

Sometimes it is useful to see and then modify the MDX query that the system generates for a pivot table. To do so:

1.

Click the Query Text button

.

The system then displays a dialog box that displays the query used by this pivot table.

2.

If you want to use a different query, click Manual Mode.

3. Edit the query. See the following subsection for an example.

If you had displayed a detail listing, the bottom area of this dialog box also displays the listing query that the system
used:

4. Click OK.

When the Analyzer displays a pivot table that is defined by a manually edited or manually entered MDX query , the Query

Text button changes to the following:
use locally defined calculated members unless you also add the appropriate WITH clause to your query. You can, however,
drag items to the Filters box; the system applies these filters b ut does not modify the manual query text. That is, the base
query and its filters are stored separately within the pi vot table definition.

. Also, the Rows, Columns, and Measures boxes are grayed out. You cannot

Tip: You can also use the Query Text option to copy and paste the query (for example, to use in the MDX shell).

#### 6.14.1 Modifying Details of the 80/20 Suppression Option

For example, if you had used the 80/20 suppression option, the MDX query might look like this (with harmless line breaks
added):

SELECT
NON EMPTY {[Measures].[Amount Sold],[Measures].[Units Sold],[Measures].[%COUNT]}
ON 0,
NON EMPTY
{TOPPERCENT([Product].[P1].[Product Name].Members,80),
%LABEL(SUM(BOTTOMPERCENT([Product].[P1].[Product Name].Members,20)),"Other",,,,"font-style:italic;")}

ON 1
FROM [HoleFoods]

For the TOPPERCENT and BOTTOMPERCENT functions:

1. The first ar gument specifies the set of members to use.

2. The second argument specifies the percentage.

3. The third argument (omitted in the preceding example) specifies the measure to use for ranking the members.

To change the percentages, change the second arguments for TOPPERCENT and BOTTOMPERCENT. For example:

SELECT
NON EMPTY {[Measures].[Amount Sold],[Measures].[Units Sold],[Measures].[%COUNT]} ON 0,
NON EMPTY
{TOPPERCENT([Product].[P1].[Product Name].Members,90),
%LABEL(SUM(BOTTOMPERCENT([Product].[P1].[Product Name].Members,10)),"Other",,,,"font-style:italic;")}
ON 1
FROM [HoleFoods]

For details on MDX, see Using InterSystems MDX and InterSystems MDX Reference.

This page discusses how to work with Business Intelligence pivot tables.

### 7.1 Opening a Saved Pivot Table

To open a saved pivot table:

1. Click Open. Or click Menu > Open.

The system displays a dialog box, which shows names of folders and of pivot tables that are not in any folders.

2. Optionally click the name of a folder.

The dialog box then shows the contents of that folder.

Repeat as necessary if your folders are nested.

3. Click the name of the pivot table you want to open.

4. Click Go.

The system closes the dialog box and then displays the selected pivot table in the Analyzer.

In most cases, the underlying query is executed automatically. If it is not, click the Refresh button

. See the next topic.

### 7.2 Disabling and Enabling Auto-Execution

By default, when you make any change to the pivot table, the Analyzer re-executes the query and redisplays the results. You can disable this auto-execution. To do so, clear the Auto-execute option on the toolbar. Later, to enable auto-execution, select the Auto-execute option.

Note:

If you disable auto-execution and save the pivot table, that change is saved as part of the pivot table definition and affects the behavior of any dashboards that use the pivot table. Therefore, you should be careful to make this change and save it only if you do not want the pivot table to run automatically in dashboards, though actions may still be invoked from the Analyzer with the current query described by the pivotTable object even if said pivotTable has not been executed. Be sure to include a refresh control in any widget that displays this pivot table. For more information, refer to this section on manual query editing.

### 7.3 Canceling a Running Query

While the Analyzer is executing a query, you can cancel it. To do so, click the Cancel Query button

.

### 7.4 Exporting Data to Microsoft Excel or CSV file

From the Analyzer, you can export the data in a pivot table to Microsoft Excel or to a CSV file by selecting the Export

current results button

in the Pivot Builder area. On a dashboard, you can also export data to Microsoft Excel from

a pivot table widget, but not from other types of widgets. To do so, select the Export to Excel button

in the widget.

In the Analyzer, when you export data to CSV by selecting the CSV option from the drop-down menu, the system generates a file that includes the contents of the pi vot table, including the column and row labels. The cell values for a given row are separated by comma characters (,), and rows are separated by line breaks. When you select the CSV with Heading option from the drop-down menu, the file includes the same contents as a file e xported using the CSV option, with an additional
line at the beginning. This line is a heading that identifies the data:

- If the data is derived from a saved pivot table, the heading contains the relative path to the pivot table and the pivot table’s name (for example: "Patient Pivots/Avg Score by Age")

- If the data is not derived from a saved pivot table, the heading provides the name of the source cube or subject area When you export data to Microsoft Excel, the system generates an Excel file that contains all the data currently displayed in the widget. The file has the name %DeepSee.UI.MDXExcel.zen.xls, %DeepSee.UI.MDXExcel.zen-1.xls, or similar. Your browser then does one of the following, depending on your operating system, the configured file types on your machine,
your browser, and your browser settings:

- Opens the file with Excel (or other selected program).

You specify the program to use by setting a browser option. For example, on Firefox, you use Tools > Options > Applications. This option also enables you to specify whether the browser should open the file with this program or prompt you to save it to the hard drive.

Note:

The exported file, while created with an .xls extension, is formatted as an HTML spreadsheet. Excel will prompt you with a warning about the format and extension not matching, but this does not indicate an unusable or unsafe file. When prompted to open the file an yway, click Yes.

- Prompts you to open the file with Excel (or other selected program, as described in the pre vious bullet).

- Opens this file within the current bro wser window.

This is the default behavior for Windows operating systems earlier than Windows Vista. You can change this behavior on the Edit File Type dialog box (which you access via My Computer > Tools > Folder Options or My Computer > View > Options, depending on the operating system version).

This option is not available on Windows Vista and later Windows operating systems.

Printing a Pivot Table

- Prompts you to save the file to the hard dri ve.

- Automatically saves the file to the hard dri ve.

Exporting to Excel, does not support exporting more than 250000 rows. Also, if the cube is based on a data connector that uses an external table, there is a limit of 1000 rows in the listing.

Note:

If no numeric formatting is specified, an y numbers are formatted as integers by default. (The actual values are available in Excel, and you can change the formatting as needed to display them appropriately). If numeric formatting is specified in the model or in the pi vot table definition, that formatting is used in Excel.

### 7.5 Printing a Pivot Table

To print a pivot table from the Analyzer, click the Print button default browser. You can then use options in the browser to print the file or to do wnload it, for printing later.

. The system generates a .pdf file and opens it in your

Note that if you download the file, the bro wser saves the file to the def ault download directory for that browser; there is
no mechanism to specify a different location.

Also see Specifying the Print Settings.

#### 7.5.1 Requirements for Printing

When a user invokes the Print option, InterSystems IRIS® data platform uses Java to call out to a third-party PDF rendering tool. The call out operation takes place using the /api/deepsee REST interface. This means that Java (or specifically JRE, Java Runtime Environment) is required on the user's machine.

This also means that you must configure security settings for your application appropriately . A user must hold the %System_CallOut:Use privilege in order to invoke the Print option. Furthermore, invoking the Print option may prompt the user to authenticate again if you have not configured the /api/deepsee web application to share a common authentication mechanism with the /csp/ web application for your namespace, which serves the Analyzer. (Similar problems may occur navigating between any two Management Portal pages which are served by different web applications.)

For information on the requirements, see Configuring InterSystems IRIS for PDF Output

.

### 7.6 Sending Email

You can send email that contains a link to the pivot table, if your system is configured for this. To do so:

1. Open a pivot table that contains the data about which you want to send a message.

2. Click Menu > Send Email.

If this option is not present, then your system is not configured to support email.

3. The system then does one of the following:

- Displays the default email system on your machine, with a message that contains a link to the dashboard.

- Edit the message, specify one or recipients, and send it as usual.

Displays a dialog box.

Choose a recipient, type a brief message to include along with the generated link, and click OK.

### 7.7 Displaying the Pivot Table as a Chart

By default, the Analyzer displays the results in table format. You can use the buttons in the upper left to switch to other formats.

To display the results as a table, click the Display As Table button

.

Displaying the Pivot Table as a Chart

If you click the Chart Options button

, the Analyzer displays the following page:

Here you can do the following:

- Specify a new title. To do so, type a value into Title.

- Specify a chart type. To do so, click the button in the Chart Type section.

- Control the display of grid lines. To do so, click a button in the Grid Lines section.

- Control the text size. To do so, click a button in the Text Size section.

- Specify the minimum value to display on the vertical axis. To do so, type a value into Minimum Axis Value.

- Specify the maximum value to display on the vertical axis. To do so, type a value into Maximum Axis Value.

Notes that these changes do not affect the definition of the pi vot table. When you add a pivot table to a dashboard, you can choose a chart type. Furthermore, a chart displays only the first 100 items.

For information on the chart types, see Available Chart Types.

### 7.8 Deleting a Pivot Table

To delete a pivot table in the Analyzer, click Delete.

Note: When you delete a pivot table, the system moves it into a folder named $TRASH. Or, if the pivot table is already
in a folder, then $TRASH/ is prepended to the folder name. In either case, the pivot table is no longer visible in
the web-based interfaces.

Deleting a Pivot Table

This page describes ways to analyze the data you see when viewing a pivot table in the Business Intelligence Analyzer.

### 8.1 Displaying a Detail Listing

A detail listing displays fields at the lo west level, for the records associated with one or more selected cells. You can display a default listing, select a different listing to display, or even select the fields to display . You can also sort the detail listing. The following subsections provide the details and also describe how to exit the listing.

Note:

If you display a listing and save the pivot table, the Analyzer saves its listing state. That is, when you next open it, the Analyzer redisplays the pivot table as a listing. Similarly, if it is included in any dashboards, it is displayed there as a listing.

#### 8.1.1 Displaying the Default Detail Listing

To display the default detail listing:

1. Display a pivot table as usual.

2. Click the data cells in the row or rows.

To select multiple cells, hold the Shift key down while clicking the cells.

To select an entire row, click the row label on the left. To click an entire column, click the column header.

The listing option is not available for cells in a total row or a total column.

3.

Click the Listing button

.

The Pivot Preview area displays something like the following:

If there are more than 100 rows, the bottom area displays buttons that you can use to page through all the rows.

The Pivot Builder area now displays the Custom Listing Fields box, which is for use when you select fields to display , if possible.

#### 8.1.2 Displaying a Different Detail Listing

To display a different listing:

1. Display the default listing as described earlier.

2. Select Detail Listings in the Model Contents area.

3. Click the name of the listing to display.

Typically each listing uses a different set of fields and is meant for a dif ferent purpose.

If the name of a listing is italicized, that indicates that this listing is defined in a listing group and that you have the necessary permissions to modify the listing. See Defining Listing Groups .

Or, before you display the listing, do the following:

1.

Click the Pivot Options button

.

2. Select a listing from the Listing drop-down menu.

3. Click OK.

#### 8.1.3 Creating a Custom Listing

Depending on the subject area, you might be able to create a custom listing that uses fields that you select. To do so:

1. Display the default listing as described earlier.

2. Select Detail Listings in the Model Contents area.

3. Select Custom Listing.

The system then displays a listing that initially shows only the IDs of the records.

4. Optionally clear the Auto-execute check box.

This is helpful if the listing uses many records, because each time when you change the listing definition, the system reruns the corresponding query by default. When Auto-execute is off, the system does not rerun the query automatically.

5. Expand the Custom Listing folder. For example:

Displaying a Detail Listing

This folder lists the available listing fields in this subject area.

Note that the sample Patients cube defines a listing named Custom listing. This listing is an ordinary listing defined with custom syntax and cannot be used as described here.

6. Drag listing fields from this area to the Custom Listing Fields box.

7.

If you cleared the Auto-execute check box, use the Refresh button

in the Pivot Builder area.

The system then runs the query and displays the results. For example:

#### 8.1.4 Sorting a Listing

By default, the definition of a listing controls the order of the ro ws.

You can instead sort the listing by the values shown in any data column. To do so, double-click the column header.

The first time you double-click the column header , the listing is sorted in ascending order, by the values in that column, and the column header includes the >> characters to indicate this sorting.

If you double-click the column header again, the listing is sorted in descending order instead (and the column header includes the << characters). If you double-click a third time, the sorting is removed and the default order is restored.

Listings on pivots based on data connectors cannot be sorted.

#### 8.1.5 Exiting the Listing

To exit the listing and redisplay the pivot table, do either of the following:

Click the left arrow button

- Click the Display Table button:

- 8.2 Drilldown via Double-Click In some cases, you can drill down by double-clicking a row (other than a total row).

In some of these cases, the system uses the hierarchy, if any, to determine how to drill down. In other cases, the system drills down in a custom manner, as defined in the pi vot table.

Note:

The drilldown action has no effect if the pivot table uses a manually entered MDX query. See Specifying the MDX Query Manually.

#### 8.2.1 Drilldown in a Hierarchy

This section describes drilldown in a hierarchy. For example, in the Patients sample, The ZIP code level is the parent of
the city level. Consider the following pivot table:

If you double-click the cell 38928, the system displays the following in the upper right of the pivot builder area:

And the pivot table looks like this:

#### 8.2.2 Custom Double-Click Drilldown

To customize how the system drills down, see Customizing Double-Click Drilldown. This section provides a demonstration.

For example, consider the following pivot table:

Drilldown via Double-Click

Suppose that for this pivot table, we specify Drilldown Expression as follows:

colord.h1.[favorite color].members gend.h1.gender.members

If we double-click the cell 32006, the pivot table then looks like this:

If we double-click the cell None, the pivot table then looks like this:

If we double-click again, nothing further happens.

#### 8.2.3 Saving the Drilldown

If you drill down in a pivot table and then save it, the Analyzer saves its drilldown state. That is, when you next open it, the Analyzer redisplays the pivot table with the drilldown. Similarly, if the pivot table is included in any dashboards, they display it in its drilldown state.

#### 8.2.4 Clearing the Drilldown

To clear the drilldown of a pivot table, you can do any of the following:

- Click the left arrow button in the toolbar.

- Click the X button in the Drill down area in the toolbar, if applicable.

- Click the << arrows in any of the rows in the pivot table.

### 8.3 Performing Arbitrary Drilldown

In the drilldown action, you focus on a row in the pivot table and see a different breakout for that row. To drill down in an arbitrary way, drag and drop any level from the Model Contents pane onto the non-scrolling part of a row in the pivot table.

For example, suppose that you start with the following pivot table:

Suppose that you expand the level list in the Model Contents pane (not shown) to display the birth year 1989. Then drag and drop 1989 onto Elm Heights. The system displays the label Drilldown: Year 1989 in the upper right of the pivot builder
area, and the pivot table looks like this:

This option is not available for a total row.

Also see Saving the Drilldown State and Clearing the Drilldown State, earlier in this page.

Note:

The drilldown action has no effect if the pivot table uses a manually entered MDX query. See Specifying the MDX Query Manually.

### 8.4 Introduction to the Pivot Analysis Window

The Analyzer also provides the Pivot Analysis window, which you can use for several specialized analyses. In each case, you first select one or more cells, and the analysis considers the lo west-level data associated with those cells. To access
this window:

1. Click the data cells in the row or rows.

To select multiple cells, hold the Shift key down while clicking the cells.

To select an entire row, click the row label on the left. To click an entire column, click the column header.

The analysis option is not available for cells in a total row or a total column.

2.

Click the Analysis button

.

For details, see Using the Analysis Window. (The same analysis options are also present in dashboards.)

Configuring InterSystems IRIS for PDF
Output

When you print from Business Intelligence to PDF, InterSystems IRIS® data platform uses Java to call out to a third-party PDF rendering tool. The rendering tool applies the XSLT stylesheet to the XML data and transforms the XML into XSL- FO. Finally, the tool transforms the XSL-FO into PDF.

The InterSystems IRIS installation provides a version of Apache FOP to use as the default PDF rendering engine. You can also use another rendering engine, such as XEP PDF from RenderX, or download and install FOP from Apache.

A.1 Using the Built-in PDF Rendering Engine

The PDF rendering process works only if you have performed the required configuration steps. This section discusses configuration for the b uilt-in FOP. For information on configuring alternate PDF renderers, see the section Using Other
Rendering Engines.

1.

If you do not already have a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed on the server, download and install this tool on your system. The JVM is included in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and the Java Developers Kit (JDK) supported by this version of InterSystems IRIS, so if you have either of these tools you already have a JVM. Alternatively, you may install and use one of the supported versions of OpenJDK.

In order for InterSystems IRIS to find Ja va, you need to define the J AVA_HOME environment variable and set it to the location where you have installed your JDK. JAVA_HOME is described in the Java documentation. You must also add your JDK installation’s /bin/ directory path to your system’s PATH variable.

2. You must ensure that user privileges are set correctly. To generate PDF output, the user must be logged in to a user

account that has the %System_CallOut:USE privilege.

3. You can create custom configuration files for the b

uilt-in FOP as described in materials on the Apache FOP Web site:

http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop

If you want the InterSystems IRIS callout to FOP to use a custom configuration file, you can set the global ^%SYS("zenreport","transformerconfig") to the path of the configuration file. Configuration files are important for adding fonts to FOP. You must first create font metrics, and then re gister them with FOP. The process is described on the Apache FOP web site.

If you modify the FOP configuration file configuration file that comes with your InterSystems IRIS distrib becomes corrupted for any reason (such as running RenderX, which truncates the file if the parameter USEINST ALLED-

fop.xconf, then an InterSystems IRIS install does not copy over it. The FOP

ution is named fop.xconf_dist. If your fop.xconf file

Configuring InterSystems IRIS for PDF Output

FOP is not set to zero), you can revert to the file as distrib uted with InterSystems IRIS by copying fop.xconf_dist to fop.xconf.

Note:

PDF rendering can consume a lot of memory. If you run into trouble, you might want to modify the FOP.bat or XEP.bat file to increase the amount of memory a vailable to the Java Virtual Machine. The respective products provide documentation that explains how to do this.

A.2 Using Other Rendering Engines

A version of Apache FOP is installed with InterSystems IRIS. If you chose to use another PDF rendering tool, you must perform the following additional configuration steps.

1.

Install the XSL-FO to PDF rendering tool. Two of the available options are:

- An open source project from Apache called FOP. You can download it from the following Web site:

http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop

To install, simply extract the files from the kit.

- The XEP product from RenderX. You can download a free trial version that produces a RenderX watermark on
each output page, or you can buy the XEP product. See this Web site for details:

- http://www.renderx.com/tools/xep.html To install, follow the instructions in the kit.

To configure InterSystems IRIS to w ork with RenderX XEP, you need to define a %J AVA_HOME% and a %XEP_HOME% environment variable. %JAVA_HOME% is described in the Java documentation. %XEP_HOME% is an environment variable specifying the location where you have installed XEP.

2. Configure InterSystems IRIS with the full pathname of the command file that in

vokes the rendering tool. For XEP or FOP on Windows or UNIX®, once you have installed the tool as instructed in Step 1, this command file is present on your system under the installation directory for the tool, for example C:\fop-0.95\fop.bat for Windows or /fop-0.95/fop on UNIX®.

To perform this configuration, na vigate to System Administration > Configuration > Report Servers > Settings, and
make the following changes:

- Path and File Name For PDF Generation: — Enter the path to the executable file. Click Browse to locate and select the command file.

- Foxit / Adobe Path for Pdfprint: — Ignore this field.

- Configuration File For PDF Rendering Engine: — This field is optional. Select Use or None. If you select Use, enter the path to the FOP configuration file. If you do not specify a FOP configuration file, the FOP renderer uses the configuration file supplied with the b

- uilt-in FOP.

- Do not enter a path in this field if you are using an XEP renderer . The XEP renderer truncates any file specified here to 0 length. Click Browse to locate and select the configuration file.

You can create custom configuration files as described by the tool pro custom configuration file, you need to follo w the manual for XEP.

vider’s Web site. To provide XEP with a

Default HotJVM Render Server Port — Enter the port number where the HotJVM Render Server is running.

Verify Now — Click this button to test whether or not the rendering tool is configured correctly .

Using Other Rendering Engines

Alternatively, start the Terminal and set the corresponding global nodes. For example, to set the renderer executable:

Set ^%SYS("zenreport","transformerpath")="/Applications/fop-0.95/fop.bat"

Similarly, to set the configuration file, set ^%SYS("zenreport","transformerconfig") to the path of the configuration file.

3. The default behavior is to use the installed FOP, unless you have set an alternative renderer on the Management Portal

Report Settings page.

Note:

If you are using FOP version 0.94 or earlier, you must set a flag to specify that an older FOP v ersion is the rendering
tool. To do this, enter the following commands in the Terminal:

set $namespace = "%SYS"
set ^%SYS("zenreport","oldfop")=1
