# Transact-SQL (TSQL) Migration Guide

Planning and Performing TSQL Migration

InterSystems TSQL is an implementation of the Transact-SQL procedural language which supports many of the features of both the Sybase and Microsoft implementations. Transact-SQL is used with Sybase Adaptive Server, Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL), and other platforms.

Note:

Sybase Adaptive Server (ASE) is the implementation primarily described on this page, though much of this information is relevant to any Transact-SQL implementation.

InterSystems TSQL also contains a few proprietary extensions not found in either of these implementations. These are described in Commands and System Stored Procedures.

This document will help you to effectively migrate your schemas, stored procedures and data from a Transact-SQL database application and it will provide you with an understanding of the TSQL (Transact-SQL) implementation for InterSystems IRIS® data platform to maintain and enhance it after the initial migration.

### 1.1 Why Migrate to InterSystems IRIS?

InterSystems IRIS provides an efficient and modern SQL implementation deli vering speed, scale and security to missioncritical applications in many industries. These performance benefits, the v ertical and horizontal scalability and enterprisegrade security also apply to TSQL applications migrated to InterSystems IRIS.

All data in an InterSystems IRIS database is stored in efficient, tree-based sparse multidimensional arrays called globals. Because they are accessed directly with no file system layer needed, InterSystems IRIS globals pro vide very fast, fle xible storage and retrieval. Globals underlie the InterSystems IRIS object and SQL interfaces, support the Key/Value and No SQL paradigms, and allow InterSystems IRIS to easily handle dynamic data types such as XML or JSON.

InterSystems SQL provides high-performance access through highly optimized ODBC and JDBC drivers that have been enhanced to fully support TSQL syntax. It also provides a SQL Gateway capability to facilitate accessing and importing data from other relational databases.

#### 1.1.1 Running your TSQL Applications on InterSystems IRIS

When you run TSQL code on the InterSystems IRIS platform, the code is compiled into the corresponding InterSystems SQL and ObjectScript code. ObjectScript is InterSystems object-oriented programming language. The compiled code is run on InterSystems IRIS and available for debugging purposes, if needed. This compilation step is fully automated and not a one-time migration task. The migration effort consists of loading the schema, data and TSQL code from the old environment to InterSystems IRIS. From then on you can continue to use and modify the TSQL application code, simply recompiling it after making any changes.

InterSystems IRIS provides many interfaces for running TSQL code. These interfaces provide a dialect option that specifies either Sybase or MSSQL.

Regardless of which of these interfaces or dialects is used, InterSystems IRIS will only execute the corresponding InterSystems SQL and ObjectScript code. InterSystems IRIS does not run TSQL natively.

#### 1.1.2 Migrating off Sybase Products

The initial implementation of InterSystems TSQL was designed to support the migration of Sybase ASE code. It provides support for the vast majority of native ASE TSQL commands and system stored procedures.

It fully supports or accepts most ASE schema options, including datetime formats. It supports compiling ASE TSQL stored procedure code to InterSystems SQL and ObjectScript.

InterSystems IRIS performance is significantly higher than Sybase ASE when run on the same hardware. InterSystems Mirroring capability offers more robust resiliency than Sybase ASE database replication and InterSystems Enterprise Cache Protocol (ECP) and sharding offer more fle xible options for scaling out.

Sybase's other products, Sybase ASA and Sybase IQ, involves slight differences in TSQL support and dialect. While some customers have migrated successfully from Sybase ASA, it is recommended that you work with InterSystems Support when planning such a migration.

While Sybase IQ is well-known for its high performance, customers that have moved their workloads from Sybase IQ to InterSystems IRIS have experienced even higher levels of performance than they did on their previous platform.

#### 1.1.3 Migrating off Microsoft Products

Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) and Azure Database use a different TSQL dialect that has evolved significantly since it parted ways with Sybase TSQL. InterSystems IRIS supports a subset of the MSSQL dialect. However, InterSystems IRIS TSQL was principally designed to support migration of code in the Sybase dialect. It provides more limited support for Microsoft TSQL compatibility and migration.

### 1.2 Planning your Migration

While migrating a TSQL application means you will end up with the same schema, data and application code (but just on a different platform), it is still worthwhile planning this project carefully.

#### 1.2.1 Planning the Infrastructure

InterSystems IRIS typically requires fewer hardware resources than other database platforms to run the same TSQL workload. This means migrating to InterSystems IRIS is an appropriate time to consider the infrastructure on which to run your TSQL
application:

- Leverage InterSystems IRIS efficiencies and vertical scalability to determine the minimal hardware for your TSQL application.

- InterSystems IRIS also runs in containers. When deployed in the cloud, different Cloud Service Providers offer a wide range of options to right-size your environment.

- Mirroring offers a robust and proven mechanism to implement your High Availability and Disaster Recovery require- ments.

Planning your Migration

- InterSystems IRIS can use Asynchronous Mirrored Reporting Servers to offload queries from the database serv er, providing significantly enhanced performance in high query usage systems. A Reporting Server can provide a subset of the data on the database server, if desired.

- For the most demanding workloads, InterSystems IRIS also supports scaling out for user and data volume independently by deploying multiple machines in a cluster.

InterSystems Technology Architects are available for consultation to assist you in this process.

#### 1.2.2 Reviewing your Application Schema and Code

InterSystems IRIS TSQL supports the vast majority of TSQL concepts and language elements and will accept most schema options. Still, it is appropriate to review your TSQL application to determine if it relies on any of the few constructs not currently supported. The easiest way to validate this is by simply importing the TSQL schema and code on IRIS and compile it. The InterSystems IRIS TSQL compiler will flag an y issues it finds in the imported code so the y can be addressed, either by changing the original TSQL code to use a supported alternative, or by choosing to re-implement specific procedures in
ObjectScript.

##### 1.2.2.1 TSQL features not supported on InterSystems IRIS

InterSystems IRIS coverage of TSQL features differs depending on the dialect the code was originally developed for. Due to differences in how schema and aliases are handled, there are some limitations with certain specific handling of SQL aliases as well as schema naming. These can be circumvented by appropriately matching schema names in the DDL, and careful use of mixing table names and aliases in SQL queries.

Many table properties and other schema options are platform-specific. These may not make a difference in the behavior of the table from the user or application point of view. This includes many storage-related properties such as partitioning and compression clauses, but also orthogonal features such as encryption. InterSystems IRIS TSQL will silently accept and ignore many properties that have no impact on behavior, but will report a compilation error when they do.

##### 1.2.2.2 Client access to TSQL code on InterSystems IRIS

InterSystems IRIS TSQL supports a command-line SQL Shell which you can use to issue TSQL commands and queries directly. You must initially set the dialect for the current SQL Shell session to the preferred value. For example, SET DIALECT = Sybase.

TSQL commands can also be issued from Java-based applications through the JDBC or ODBC driver by setting the dialect accordingly.

InterSystems SQL provides an even broader set of accessibility options when using InterSystems SQL and ObjectScript, including ultra-fast, native access to the underlying storage paradigm. For further details, refer to InterSystems IRIS documentation.

#### 1.2.3 Reviewing your Data

InterSystems IRIS is a full multi-model database and supports a broad variety of data types. Most data types available in TSQL are also available on InterSystems IRIS and the Data Definition Language (DDL) statements to create tables will automatically map those types appropriately. InterSystems IRIS also supports both traditional row-oriented storage models, as are typical for Sybase ASE, Sybase ASA, and Microsfot SQL Server, and an analytics-focused columnar storage model, as is the case for Sybase IQ.

#### 1.2.4 Project Planning

The following are important consideration when determining the scope of your migration to InterSystems IRIS:

- Availability of TSQL expertise for a general understanding of the code.

- Availability of the original TSQL application developers for functional questions.

- Availability of unit tests or other test scripts to validate the migration.

- Initial assessment of schema and code. Determining complexity and presence of unsupported features.

- Assessing the size of the data set.

- Agreement on your requirements for switching over, either an all-at-once conversion or a phased conversion.

In the process of migration you may use any combination of the following approaches:

- Migrating all TSQL code and then fixing incompatible code.

- Migrating compatible TSQL code and then augmenting with new development in InterSystems SQL and ObjectScript.

- Letting TSQL and IRIS SQL systems run side-by-side, leveraging the benefits of each and k eeping the data in sync. InterSystems can assist you in determining what to migrate based upon an agreed-upon level of performance and service.

#### 1.2.5 Testing the Migration

Unit tests are an essential part of any application development project and crucial for testing application code changes as well as upgrades of the underlying infrastructure. As such, they are also extremely valuable when migrating an application to a new platform, such as InterSystems IRIS. For TSQL applications, unit tests written in TSQL can be migrated along with the TSQL application code. Unit tests driven from an external facility, such as Java-based application code or frameworks such as Jenkins, can also be reused as-is.

In testing the migration of TSQL code and data sets the following are important additional considerations:

- Performance tests. Are application response times as good or better than the previous platform?

- Scalability tests. Can I support larger user and/or data volumes compared to the previous platform, optionally engaging additional hardware resources?

- Correctness tests. Some semantics may differ between InterSystems TSQL and the previous platform (as they do between different TSQL implementations), such as the resolution of outer joins in SQL queries offered by Sybase ASE. Correctness tests are particularly important to guarantee users observe the same behavior and results after the migration.

### 1.3 Executing the Plan

To migrate existing TSQL applications to InterSystems TSQL, you need to perform four operations: configure InterSystems IRIS for TSQL, migrate the TSQL source code, migrate the metadata (DDL), and migrate the data. InterSystems and its implementation partners are available to assist in each of these tasks.

#### 1.3.1 Setting Up the System

Some of InterSystems IRIS default system settings differ from the default configuration of Sybase ASE and other TSQL platforms. InterSystems and professional service partners with TSQL migration experience can provide scripts to prepare a freshly installed InterSystems IRIS instance for use with TSQL applications.

To configure your system for TSQL manually, using the InterSystems IRIS configuration utilities:

Executing the Plan

- Go into the InterSystems IRIS Management Portal. Select System Administration, Configuration, SQL and Object Settings, then select TSQL Compatibility. Here you can specify the dialect (Sybase or MSSQL), and turn on or off the ANSI_NULLS, CASEINSCOMPARE, and QUOTED_IDENTIFIER settings. The default for all three is “off”, which is the appropriate setting for Sybase ASE.

- From the Management Portal, select System Administration, Configuration, SQL and Object Settings, then SQL. From here, you can set the Default Schema. This is the default schema name (which maps to a package) for all unqualified DDL entities, such as table names and procedure names.

- Set Equal Literal Replacement to OFF. This is the appropriate setting for Sybase ASE.

- Set the default collation sequence to %SQLSTRING. Collation options perform string conversions only for the purpose
of index collation; the stored data is not changed. The %SQLSTRING option corresponds to the default binary collation
on Sybase ASE. It is important to verify that this setting matches the Sybase sort order. This step must be done before loading any data.

- Truncation settings may be required for Sybase implementations where there are trailing spaces in the database at the end of strings. Truncating these strings will allow for proper string matching. See Data Collation and String Truncation.

- Consider using Posix time instead of the default timestamp to increase performance. See Timestamp and Time Precision.

- Temporary tables are fully supported. Their settings should be optimized for speed if they are heavily used. See Settings for Temporary Databases.

- From the Management Portal, select System Administration, Configuration, SQL and Object Settings, then User DDL Mappings. You can use this option to map any needed user-defined data types .

#### 1.3.2 Migrating the Code

The initial application migration is simple:

1.

Import the DDL: Import table and view definitions using either the %SYSTEM.SQL.Schema.ImportDDL() method
(for single files) or the $SYSTEM.SQL.Schema.ImportDDLDir() method (for multiple files in a directory). Within
these methods, you set the DDLMode parameter to either "MSSQLServer" or "Sybase". These methods import DDL statements, as well as DML statements such as INSERT, convert them to equivalent InterSystems IRIS SQL, and execute them. For further details, see Importing SQL Code.

Alternatively, you can invoke the $SYSTEM.SQL.Schema.LoadSybase() or
$SYSTEM.SQL.Schema.LoadMSSQLServer() method to import the schema. For further details, see Importing SQL
Code.

If the TSQL source contains CREATE PROC statements, then a class method containing the CREATE PROC source is created. InterSystems IRIS places this class method in either an existing class or in a new class whose name is based on the schema and procedure name. If the procedure already exists, then the existing version is replaced by the new version. If a class matching the class name generated from the schema and procedure already exists, then this class name is used — if it was previously generated by the TSQL utility. If not, then a unique class name is generated, based on the schema and procedure name. The resulting class is compiled once the procedure has been successfully created. If logging is requested then the source statements are logged along with the name of the containing class, class method, and the formal arguments generated. Any errors encountered by the process are also reported in the log. If an error is detected during CREATE PROC processing, InterSystems IRIS deletes any new class that was generated for that procedure.

2.

Inspect the log file for err ors: Search by Error #. A summary count of errors and successful imports will appear at the end of the log. In most cases, errors can be worked around or addressed by using information found in this document.

3. Compile: When you import DDL, table and view definition compilation is automatically performed. To compile other

TSQL source code, it is best to use the command as follows:

ObjectScript

DO $SYSTEM.OBJ.CompileAll("-l")

The lowercase “L” qualifier flag specifies that locking
flag qualifiers, call DO $SYSTEM.OBJ.ShowFlags().

is not applied for the duration of the compile. For a full list of

#### 1.3.3 Migrating the Data

The following are options for migrating data:

- Set up an SQL Gateway Connection, using either JDBC or ODBC for data export/import. In the Management Portal select System Administration, Configuration, Connectivity, SQL Gateway Connections, then select the Create New Connection button to define an SQL Gateway Connection.

- Use the Data Migration Wizard. In the Management Portal select System Explorer, SQL, then from the Wizards dropdown list select Data Migration to configure a Data Migration Wizard. Select an existing SQL Gateway Connection from the drop-down list. This runs a wizard to migrate data from an external source and creates an InterSystems IRIS class definition to store it.

- Use a bulk loader. InterSystems has utilities that understand the various formats in which Sybase stores datetime fields and can normalize these into a standard internal format in InterSystems IRIS. Without these transformations, data load may experience issues with datetime fields, depending on ho w these are stored in Sybase.

For a large volume of data, use a bulk loader that provides support for reading Bulk Copy Program (BCP) files, or use your preferred Extract Transform and Load (ETL) utility. InterSystems Support can provide tools for bulk data ingestion. Contact InterSystems Support for further details.

#### 1.3.4 Troubleshooting

Inspect the compile log by turning on the TSQL Trace facility. See TRACE. This produces a log that records a timestamp for each operation, the elapsed time for each operation, a global references count and a %ROWCOUNT. The log provides detailed information by TSQL statement in processed stored procedures.

Additionally, consider retaining cached query source code as well as the generated cached queries to provide detailed information on the compiled code. See Cached Query Source.

### 1.4 Writing and Executing TSQL on InterSystems IRIS

You can write and execute TSQL by using InterSystems SQL interfaces or by using an integrated development environment.

#### 1.4.1 Working with TSQL via SQL Interfaces

As an alternative to developing TSQL code within class definitions, you can use Data Definition Language (DDL) to create,
replace, or drop TSQL stored procedures. You can enter DDL commands using the following set of interfaces:

- Using the TSQL Shell The InterSystems TSQL Shell can be used to execute Transact-SQL code directly on InterSystems IRIS. To use the
TSQL Shell, invoke the TSQLShell() (or $SYSTEM.SQL.Schema.LoadTSQL()) method from the Terminal as follows:
DO $SYSTEM.SQL.TSQLShell(). This invokes the InterSystems SQL Shell and sets its DIALECT configuration
parameter to the currently configured TSQL dialect (MSSQL or Sybase). The initial configuration def ault is MSSQL.

Writing and Executing TSQL on InterSystems IRIS

When entering SQL code interactively, the TSQL Shell supports, but does not require, the semicolon (;) statement
delimiter at the end of each SQL statement.

You can use the Shell’s RUN command to execute a TSQL script file. The RUN command displays a series of prompts, including Please enter the end-of-statement delimiter (Default is 'GO'): GO=>. This enables
you to specify the TSQL semicolon (;) as the statement delimiter in your script file, rather than the InterSystems IRIS
default GO statement. See Using the SQL Shell Interface.

- Using the InterSystems SQL Shell The InterSystems SQL Shell can be used to execute lines of TSQL code by using the SET DIALECT command to set the Shell’s dialect to Sybase or MSSQL.

When the Shell’s dialect is set to Sybase or MSSQL, the SQL Shell supports, but does not require, the semicolon (;)
statement delimiter at the end of each SQL statement. When the Shell’s dialect is set to IRIS, a semicolon (;) statement
delimiter results in an SQLCODE -25 error.

You can use the Shell’s RUN command to execute a TSQL script file. The RUN command displays a series of prompts, including Please enter the end-of-statement delimiter (Default is 'GO'): GO=>. This enables
you to specify the TSQL semicolon (;) as the statement delimiter in your script file, rather than the InterSystems IRIS
default GO statement. See Using the SQL Shell Interface.

- Using the Management Portal SQL Interface In the Management Portal SQL interface, the Dialect option allows you to set the SQL dialect to IRIS, Sybase, or MSSQL. The default is IRIS. Note that the dialect you select becomes the user customized default the next time you access the Management Portal. See Using the Management Portal SQL Interface.

- Using Dynamic SQL InterSystems IRIS Dynamic SQL, a feature of ObjectScript, can be used to execute TSQL code queries and a limited subset of other DML and DDL statements from ObjectScript code.

– You can create a Dynamic SQL statement class instance, then set the %Dialect property to Sybase or MSSQL.

You then prepare and execute a TSQL command within that object instance.

– You can execute Dynamic SQL without creating a statement class instance by invoking the

%SYSTEM.SQL.Prepare() method which prepares an SQL command, or the %SYSTEM.SQL.Execute() method, which both prepares and executes an SQL command. Both of these methods provide a Dialect parameter.

See Using Dynamic SQL.

#### 1.4.2 Working with TSQL via Class Definitions

Via an IDE, you can define InterSystems class definitions , which can include methods or class queries that you can write in TSQL and then easily project as SQL stored procedures.

A class method takes parameters and returns a single scalar result. A class query takes parameters and returns rows. If you put plain SELECT statements into a class method they will be executed but you won’t be able to get the rows.

To create a TSQL stored procedure in an IDE, create a class method marked as a stored procedure using the SqlProc keyword
and enter the language as tsql. You can use the following template as a starting point:

ClassMethod MyTestMethod() As %Integer
[ Language = tsql, ReturnResultSets, SqlName=name, SqlProc ]
{
}

See the Language, SqlProc, and SqlName keywords for method definition in the Class Definition Refer ence.

You can write and maintain triggers in TSQL. A trigger is a set of instructions that appear in TSQL code that are executed in response to a specified SQL e vent. You can use the Language=tsql class definition k eyword to specify that a trigger is written in TSQL. The UpdateColumnList class definition k eyword is only supported for TSQL. Row-level triggers are not supported for TSQL. See Using Triggers.

### 2.1 Table References

InterSystems TSQL supports table references with the InterSystems IRIS® data platform SQL format:

schema.table

The only mandatory table reference component is table. If the schema is omitted, TSQL uses the default schema name.

Other forms of Transact-SQL may use table references with up to four components, separated by dots:
server.database.owner.table. Here is how a Transact-SQL table reference is processed:

- The server. component, if present, is ignored.

- If the database. component is present and the owner. component is omitted, database is mapped to the schema name. Therefore, database..table maps to schema.table. This conversion is not performed if the database name is 'master'.

- If the owner. component is present, it is mapped to the schema name.

For the purposes of name translation, a field name has the field suffix remo replaced afterwards.

ved while translation is performed and then

### 2.2 Temporary Tables

InterSystems TSQL supports #tablename temporary tables. A #tablename temporary table is visible to the current procedure of the current process. It is also visible to any procedure called from the current procedure. #tablename syntax is only supported in TSQL procedures (class methods projected as procedures with language tsql).

A temporary table is defined by using CREATE TABLE with a table name starting with "#". The temporary table is created at runtime. A #tablename table definition goes out of scope when you e xit the procedure. All temporary table definitions go out of scope when the connection is dropped. You can also explicitly delete a temporary table using DROP TABLE.

However, if a temporary table is referenced by an active result set, the temporary table may become invisible to the process, but the data and definition are retained until the result set goes out of scope.

A #tablename temporary table is visible both to the creating procedure and to any procedures called from that procedure. Temporary tables are visible to nested procedure calls. It is not necessary to declare the temporary table in the called procedure. If the called procedure also creates a temporary table with the same name, InterSystems IRIS uses the most recently

created table definition. Because a temporary table is defined using an ObjectScript local v
and deletion of these tables are not journaled transaction events; rolling back the transaction has no effect on these operations.

ariable, the creation, modification,

### 2.3 System Tables

System tables exist per InterSystems IRIS namespace.

Systypes

Partially supported.

### 2.4 Transactions

Code generated for BEGIN TRAN, COMMIT and ROLLBACK uses explicit transaction mode, but following a transaction TSQL always restores the mode which was active before the BEGIN TRAN statement. TSQL restores this mode when the procedure is exited from, or when a COMMIT or ROLLBACK is issued, whichever comes first.

### 2.5 Cursor Name Management

You can declare the same cursor more than once, so long as only one version of the cursor is open at runtime. If the same cursor is declared more than once in a stored procedure, all but the first declaration are associated with renamed cursors. OPEN, FETCH, CLOSE, and DEALLOCATE statements are assumed to refer to the most recent DECLARE for the given cursor. Note that the lexical position of a statement within a stored procedure is all that is used to match up a cursor name with its DECLARE — no account is taken of runtime paths through the code.

Cursors inside queries are named using an extension of the scheme used in InterSystems SQL queries. For example:

TSQL

DECLARE C CURSOR FOR SELECT A FROM B -- -- DECLARE C CURSOR FOR SELECT D FROM E --

Would be effectively translated to:

SYSOBJECTS References

TSQL

DECLARE C CURSOR FOR SELECT A FROM B -- -- DECLARE Cv2 CURSOR FOR SELECT D FROM E --
OPEN Cv2
FETCH Cv2
CLOSE Cv2
DEALLOCATE Cv2

### 2.6 SYSOBJECTS References

Commonly, an application will have setup procedures that create tables, views, and the metadata for the application envi-
ronment. Such procedures will have expressions like:

TSQL

IF EXISTS (SELECT * FROM SYSOBJECTS
WHERE ID = OBJECT_ID('People'))

This determines if a table exists, in this example. It’s usually followed by a DROP and CREATE statement to reestablish the table metadata.

TSQL procedures and triggers can reference the SYSOBJECTS system table. InterSystems TSQL supports the following
columns in the SYSOBJECTS table (%TSQL.sys.objects class properties):

Column

name

id

type

deltrig

instrig

updtrig

parent_obj

schema

parent_obj_name

Description

Object name.

Object Id.

Object type: can be one of the following values:
K=PRIMARY KEY or UNIQUE constraint; P=stored
procedure; RI=FOREIGN KEY constraint; S=system
table; TR=trigger; U=user table; V=view.

Object ID of a delete trigger if the entry is a table. Table ID of a table if the entry is a trigger.

Object ID of a table’s insert trigger if the entry is a table.

Object ID of a table’s update trigger if the entry is a table.

Object identification number of parent object. For example, the table ID if a trigger or constraint.

Name of the schema in which the object resides.

Object name of parent_obj. If parent_obj=0, parent_obj_name is the same as name.

The SYSOBJECTS table is read-only. The SYSOBJECTS table may be referenced from outside a TSQL procedure or trigger by the name %TSQL_sys.objects. SYSOBJECTS is not supported for tables mapped across namespaces.

Note:

InterSystems IRIS provides the %Dictionary package of class objects that can perform the same operations as SYSOBJECTS references. For further details, refer to the %Dictionary package in the InterSystems Class Reference.

This page describe the specific TSQL language elements for InterSystems IRIS® data platform.

### 3.1 Literals

#### 3.1.1 String Literals

A string literal must be delimited by quote characters. The preferred delimiter characters are single quote characters. You can also use double quote characters as string delimiters if you specify SET DELIMITED_IDENTIFER OFF. Otherwise, double quote characters are parsed as delimiting an identifier .

If you delimit a string literal with single quote characters, you can include literal double quote characters within the string. To include a literal single quote character within the string, double it by typing two single quotes.

A string containing literal single quotes, such as 'this is an ''embedded'' string', is compiled by InterSystems IRIS to single quotes within double quotes: "this is an 'embedded' string".

#### 3.1.2 Empty Strings

When migrating Transact-SQL code to InterSystems TSQL, it may be necessary to redefine the empty string. You can do
this by setting the following InterSystems IRIS system global:

^%SYS("sql","sys","namespace",nspace,"empty string")

All of these specified v alues are keyword literals, except nspace, which is a namespace name specified as a quoted string.

CAUTION:

Changing the empty string definition should be done with e xtreme caution. It can result in data containing different representations for an empty string. It can also cause existing programs to fail when executed in this namespace. After defining the empty string, you must pur ge all cached queries and recompile all classes and routines for that namespace that use the former empty string definition.

The following ObjectScript example changes the empty string definition for the SAMPLES namespace. It first sets the empty string value to a single blank space. It then sets the empty string value to the non-printing character represented by
the ASCII code 0. (This example then immediately resets the empty string value to the InterSystems IRIS default):

ObjectScript

SET ^%SYS("sql","sys","namespace","SAMPLES","empty string")=" "
WRITE !,"Empty string set to:"
ZZDUMP ^%SYS("sql","sys","namespace","SAMPLES","empty string")
SET ^%SYS("sql","sys","namespace","SAMPLES","empty string")=$CHAR(0)
WRITE !,"Empty string set to:"
ZZDUMP ^%SYS("sql","sys","namespace","SAMPLES","empty string")
SET ^%SYS("sql","sys","namespace","SAMPLES","empty string")=""
WRITE !,"Empty string reset to:"
ZZDUMP ^%SYS("sql","sys","namespace","SAMPLES","empty string")
WRITE !,!,"End of sample program"

#### 3.1.3 NULL

In TSQL a NULL supplied to a boolean operation returns as FALSE, as shown in the following example:

DECLARE @var BINARY(1)
SELECT @var=NULL
IF @var PRINT "true" ELSE PRINT "false"

In Sybase dialect, NULL is equal to NULL. A NULL=NULL comparison returns TRUE, and a NULL != NULL comparison returns FALSE.

In MSSQL dialect, a comparison of NULL with any value returns FALSE. Thus NULL=NULL and NULL != NULL comparisons both return FALSE.

DECLARE @var BINARY(1)
SELECT @var=NULL
IF @var=NULL PRINT "true" ELSE PRINT "false"

In Sybase dialect, NULL is not equal to any value. Therefore, Not Equals (!=) comparison involving NULL and any boolean, numeric, or string value (including the empty string ("")) returns TRUE. All Equals (=), Greater Than (>) or Less Than (<) comparisons return FALSE.

In MSSQL dialect, NULL cannot be compared to a value. Thus all Equals (=), Not Equals (!=), Greater Than (>) or Less Than (<) comparisons return FALSE.

In a TSQL string concatenation operation, NULL is equivalent to an empty string. In a TSQL arithmetic operation, NULL is equivalent to 0.

#### 3.1.4 Hexadecimal

InterSystems TSQL automatically converts hexadecimal numeric literals in TSQL source code to the corresponding decimal (base-10) numeric literals.

#### 3.1.5 Reserved Words

InterSystems TSQL cannot use as identifiers the SQL Serv er reserved words. InterSystems TSQL can use InterSystems SQL reserved words (that are not also SQL Server reserved words) if the QUOTED_IDENTIFIER SQL configuration setting is set to Yes.

#### 3.1.6 Comments, Blank Lines, and Semicolons

InterSystems TSQL supports both single-line and multi-line comments.

- A single line comment continues to the rest of the line. When used in the TSQL shell, a comment does not encompass the end-of-line qualifier , such as /x or /c. InterSystems TSQL supports both –– and // as single-line comment delimiters.

- A multi-line comment begins with /* and ends with */. A comment can include nested /* ... */ comments.

Variables

TSQL

PRINT 'these are comments' -- this is a single-line comment
// this is a single-line comment
/* This is a multi-line comment
The command PRINT 'do not print' is part of the comment and is not executed */

##### 3.1.6.1 TSQL-only Statements

InterSystems TSQL provides the means to include executable statements within InterSystems IRIS TSQL code which are parsed as nonexecutable comments in Transact-SQL. A statement prefix ed with two hyphens and a vertical bar is parsed by InterSystems IRIS as an executable statement. Sybase Adaptive Server and Microsoft SQL Server consider this to be a Transact-SQL comment.

TSQL

PRINT 'any context' -- PRINT 'commented out' --| PRINT 'InterSystems only'

##### 3.1.6.2 Semicolons

You can specify a blank line by using either two hyphens or a semicolon.

A semicolon either before or after a TSQL statement is ignored. They are supported for compatibility with Transact-SQL code, such as stored procedures, that ends statements with a semicolon.

TSQL

PRINT 'no semicolon' --
PRINT 'trailing semicolon';
;
;PRINT 'leading semicolon'

### 3.2 Variables

TSQL uses DECLARE to declare the data type of a local variable. TSQL uses SET to set the value of a local variable.

A local variable name must be a valid identifier . An at sign (@) prefix to an identifier specifies that it is the name of a local variable.

Case-sensitivity differs for TSQL dialects:

- Sybase: local variable names are case-sensitive.

- MSSQL: local variable names are not case-sensitive.

InterSystems IRIS local variable names are case-sensitive.

### 3.3 Identifiers

An identifier is a name for a TSQL object, such as a table, column, view, key, index, trigger, or stored procedure. Naming
conventions for identifiers are as follo ws:

- The first character of an identifier must be a letter

- , an underscore (_) or a percent (%) character.

- Subsequent characters of an identifier may be letters, numbers, underscores (_), dollar signs ($), or pound signs (#).

- Identifiers can be of an y length, but must be unique within their first 30 characters.

- Identifiers are not case-sensiti ve.

- An identifier cannot be an SQL reserv ed word.

- A pound sign (#) prefix to an identifier specifies that it is the name of a temporary table.

An at sign (@) prefix to an identifier specifies that it is the name of a v

ariable.

Some identifiers are qualified with a schema name. F or example, schema.tablename or schema.storedprocedure. If the schema name is omitted, the identifier is unqualified. TSQL resolves unqualified identifiers by using either the systemwide default schema (for DDL) or the schemaPath property (for DML), which provides a search path of schemas to check for the specified table name or stored procedure name.

#### 3.3.1 Delimited and Quoted Identifiers

A delimited identifier is not restricted by the naming con ventions of ordinary identifiers. F or example, a delimited identifier
can be the same word as an SQL reserved word; a delimited identifier can contain space characters.

By default, both square brackets and double quotation marks can be used to delimit an identifier . These delimiters are
interchangeable; you can define a delimited identifier by enclosing it with square brack
identifier by specifying it enclosed with double quotation marks.

ets, and invoke the same delimited

You can specify a quoted identifier if the QUOTED_IDENTIFIER SQL configuration setting is set to Yes. You specify a quoted identifier by enclosing it in double quotation marks. When QUOTED_IDENTIFIER is on, double quotes are parsed as delimiting an identifier . When QUOTED_IDENTIFIER is off, double quotes are parsed as alternative delimiters for string literals. The preferable delimiters for string literals are single quotes. A quoted identifier can contain an y characters, including blank spaces.

### 3.4 Data Types

The following data types are supported for local variables and table columns. These data types are supported in that they
are parsed as valid data types; however, no range or value validation is performed.

BINARY(n) and VARBINARY(n). The (n) size specification is mandatory .

BIT

BOOLEAN

CHAR and VARCHAR

CHAR(n), NCHAR(n), VARCHAR(n), and NVARCHAR(n)

VARCHAR(MAX), and NVARCHAR(MAX). By default, these map to %Stream.GlobalCharacter.

DATETIME and SMALLDATETIME

DECIMAL, DECIMAL(p), and DECIMAL(p,s). Where p and s are integers specifying precision (total digits) and scale (decimal digits).

DOUBLE and DOUBLE PRECISION

FLOAT and FLOAT(n)

INT, BIGINT, SMALLINT, and TINYINT

MONEY and SMALLMONEY

NATIONAL

NUMERIC, NUMERIC(p), and NUMERIC(p,s). Where p and s are integers specifying precision (total digits) and scale (decimal digits).

REAL

TIMESTAMP

Note:

The Microsoft SQL Server TIMESTAMP data type is not used for date or time information. It is an integer counter of the number of times a record is inserted or updated in a table. It should not be confused with the InterSystems SQL and ODBC TIMESTAMP data type, which represents a date and time in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.nnnnnnnnn format. In TSQL, use DATETIME and SMALLDATETIME for date and time values.

ROWVERSION

SQL_VARIANT

The following SQL Server data types are supported in a specific conte xt:

CURSOR

NTEXT, TEXT By default, these map to %Stream.GlobalCharacter.

IMAGE

TABLE

The following are not implemented:

- UNIQUEIDENTIFIER stored as a 16-byte binary string. Instead use VARCHAR(32) as the data type for a globally unique ID.

- SQL92 and TSQL options

- UPDATE OF

### 3.5 Operators

#### 3.5.1 Arithmetic and Equality Operators

InterSystems TSQL supports + (addition), – (subtraction), * multiplication, / division, and % modulo arithmetic operators.

InterSystems TSQL supports the following equality and comparison operators:

- = (equal to)

- <> (not equal to) and != (not equal to)

- < (less than), !< (not less than), <= (less than or equal to)

- > (greater than), !> (not greater than), >= (greater than or equal to) When performing equality comparisons (= or <>) between date values with different data types, all date and time values are compared using the TIMESTAMP data type. Thus two dates in different formats can be meaningfully compared. A date value declared as a STRING data type can be compared to a date value declared as a DATETIME data type.

#### 3.5.2 Concatenation Operator

InterSystems TSQL supports the + (plus sign) as both a concatenation operator and the addition operator. The plus sign functions as a concatenation operator with strings. You can concatenate several strings together using this operator. If all
item are strings, TSQL performs concatenation; however, if one of the items is a number, TSQL performs addition, treating
non-numeric strings as 0.

'world'+'wide'+'web' concatenates to 'worldwideweb'

'world'+'33'+'web' concatenates to 'world33web'

'world'+33+'web' performs addition (0+33+0=33)

In a TSQL string concatenation operation, NULL is equivalent to an empty string. In a TSQL arithmetic operation, NULL is equivalent to 0. Note that because the plus sign (+) is used for both concatenation and addition, the data type declaration
of the NULL variable is critical. The following examples all return “bigdeal”:

DECLARE @var1 BINARY(1) DECLARE @var2 VARCHAR(10)
SELECT @var1=NULL,@var2=NULL
PRINT "big"+NULL+"deal" PRINT "big"+@var1+"deal" PRINT "big"+@var2+"deal"

The following example returns 0; it treats the + as an arithmetic operator and interprets the argument as 0 + 0 + 0 = 0:

DECLARE @var1 INT
SELECT @var1=NULL
PRINT "big"+@var1+"deal"

InterSystems TSQL also supports || as a concatenation operator.

#### 3.5.3 Comparison Operators

##### 3.5.3.1 BETWEEN

InterSystems TSQL supports the BETWEEN range check operator of the form: BETWEEN num1 AND num2. BETWEEN is inclusive of the specified range limits.

##### 3.5.3.2 IS NULL

InterSystems TSQL supports the IS NULL match operator. A variable is NULL if it has been declared but not assigned a value, or if it has been explicitly specified as NULL. The empty string is not NULL.

##### 3.5.3.3 LIKE

InterSystems TSQL supports the LIKE pattern match operator. LIKE performs not case-sensitive matching of letters. InterSystems TSQL also supports NOT LIKE.

#### 3.5.4 NOT Logical Operator

The NOT logical operator inverts the truth value of the statement that follows it. For example, IF NOT EXISTS(...). NOT is not case-sensitive.

#### 3.5.5 Bitwise Logical Operators

InterSystems TSQL supports the AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), and NOT (~) bitwise operators for the integer data type. The decimal integers are converted to binary, the logical operation is performed, and the resulting binary is converted to a decimal integer value. The NOT (~) operator is a unary operator that inverts bits.

This page lists the supported TSQL commands for InterSystems IRIS® data platform in the following groups:

- Data Definition Language (DDL) statements:

ALTER TABLE, CREATE TABLE, DROP TABLE

CREATE INDEX, DROP INDEX

CREATE TRIGGER, DROP TRIGGER

- InterSystems IRIS implementation of TSQL accepts, but does not require, a semicolon command terminator. When importing TSQL code to InterSystems SQL, semicolon command terminators are stripped out.

### 4.1 Data Definition Language (DDL) Statements

The following DDL statements are supported.

#### 4.1.1 CREATE TABLE

Defines a table, its fields, and their data types and constraints.

CREATE TABLE [schema. | #]tablename (fieldname datatype constraint [,...])

Specify tablename as described in Table References.

A CREATE TABLE can create a temporary table by prefixing a # character to the table name. A temporary table can only
be defined from a stored procedure; you cannot define a temporary table from Dynamic SQL outside of a stored procedure.
To create a fully-qualified temporary table name, use quotes around each name element such as the follo wing:
"SQLUser"."#mytemp".

A valid table name must begin with a letter, an underscore character (_), or a # character (for a local temporary table). Subsequent characters of a table name may be letters, numbers, or the #, $, or _ characters. Table names are not case-sensitive.

A field name must be a v alid TSQL identifier . A field name can be delimited using square brack ets. This is especially useful when defining a field that has the same name as a reserv
Check and Result:

ed word. The following example defines tw o fields named

TSQL

CREATE TABLE mytest ([Check] VARCHAR(50),[Result] VARCHAR(5))

The optional CONSTRAINT keyword can be used to specify a user-defined constraint name for a field constraint or a table constraint. You can specify multiple CONSTRAINT name type statements for a field.

InterSystems SQL does not retain constraint names. Therefore these names cannot be used by a subsequent ALTER TABLE statement.

The table field constraints DEF AULT, IDENTITY, NULL, NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY, [FOREIGN KEY] REFERENCES (the keywords FOREIGN KEY are optional), UNIQUE, CLUSTERED, and NONCLUSTERED are supported. The table constraint FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES is supported.

The field definition DEF AULT values can include the following TSQL functions: CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, CUR- RENT_USER, GETDATE, HOST_NAME, ISNULL, NULLIF, and USER.

The field definition IDENTITY constraint is supported and assigned a system-generated sequential inte arguments seed and increment are parsed, but ignored.

ger. The IDENTITY

The TSQL CREATE TABLE command can create a sharded table. The syntax for the SHARD clause is the same as for
the InterSystems SQL CREATE TABLE statement:

SHARD [ KEY fieldname { , fieldname2 } ] [ COSHARD [ WITH ] [(] tablename [)] ]

The CHECK field constraint is not supported. If a CHECK constraint is encountered while compiling TSQL source Inter- Systems IRIS generates an error message indicating that CHECK constraints are not supported. This error is logged in the compile log (if active), and the source is placed in the unsupported log (if active).

If the table already exists, an SQLCODE -201 error is issued.

The following Dynamic SQL example creates a temporary table named #mytest with four fields, populates it with data, then displays the results. The LastName field has multiple constraints. The FirstName field tak es a default. The DateStamp
field tak es a system-defined def ault:

ObjectScript

SET sql=9
SET sql(1)="CREATE TABLE #mytest (MyId INT PRIMARY KEY,"
SET sql(2)="LastName VARCHAR(20) CONSTRAINT unq_lname UNIQUE "
SET sql(3)=" CONSTRAINT nonull_lname NOT NULL,"
SET sql(4)="FirstName VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT '***TBD***',"
SET sql(5)="DateStamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)"
SET sql(6)="INSERT INTO #mytest(MyId,LastName,FirstName) VALUES (1224,'Smith','John')"
SET sql(7)="INSERT INTO #mytest(MyId,LastName) VALUES (1225,'Jones')"
SET sql(8)="SELECT MyId,FirstName,LastName,DateStamp FROM #mytest"
SET sql(9)="DROP TABLE #mytest"
SET statement=##class(%SQL.Statement).%New()
SET statement.%Dialect="MSSQL"
SET status=statement.%Prepare(.sql)
WRITE status,!
SET result=statement.%Execute()
DO result.%Display()

##### 4.1.1.1 Parsed But Ignored

The table constraint clauses WITH, ON, and TEXTIMAGE ON are parsed for compatibility, but are ignored. The index_options clause for the UNIQUE or PRIMARY KEY constraint is parsed for compatibility, but is ignored.

The following SQL Server parenthesized WITH options in a table constraint are parsed but ignored:
ALLOW_PAGE_LOCKS, ALLOW_ROW_LOCKS, DATA_COMPRESSION, FILLFACTOR, IGNORE_DUP_KEY, PAD_INDEX, and STATISTICS_NORECOMPUTE.

The field constraints CLUSTERED and NONCLUSTERED are parsed for compatibility , but are ignored.

#### 4.1.2 ALTER TABLE

Modifies the definition of a table, its fields, and their data types and constraints.

The following syntactical forms are supported:

ALTER TABLE tablename ADD fieldname datatype [DEFAULT value]
[{UNIQUE | NOT NULL} | CONSTRAINT constraintname {UNIQUE | NOT NULL} ]
ALTER TABLE tablename ALTER COLUMN fieldname newdatatype
ALTER TABLE tablename DROP COLUMN fieldname [,fieldname2]
ALTER TABLE tablename ADD tableconstraint FOR fieldname
ALTER TABLE tablename DROP tableconstraint
ALTER TABLE tablename DROP FOREIGN KEY role
ALTER TABLE tablename ADD CONSTRAINT constraint DEFAULT defaultvalue FOR fieldname
ALTER TABLE tablename ADD CONSTRAINT constraint FOREIGN KEY
ALTER TABLE tablename DROP CONSTRAINT constraint

Specify tablename as described in Table References.

- ALTER TABLE...ADD fieldname can add a field definition or a comma-separated list of field definitions:

– DEFAULT is supported.

– NOT NULL is supported if the table contains no data. If the table contains data, you can only specify NOT NULL

if the field also specifies a DEF AULT value.

– UNIQUE is parsed but ignored. To establish a unique constraint use the CREATE INDEX command with the

UNIQUE keyword.

The full supported syntax for ALTER TABLE...ADD fieldname is as follows:

ALTER TABLE tablename
[ WITH CHECK | WITH NOCHECK ] ADD fieldname datatype [DEFAULT value]
[{UNIQUE | NOT NULL} | CONSTRAINT constraintname {UNIQUE | NOT NULL} ]
[ FOREIGN KEY (field1[,field2[,...]]) REFERENCES tablename(field1[,field2[,...]]) ]

WITH CHECK | WITH NOCHECK is parsed by InterSystems IRIS, but is ignored. In Transact-SQL, WITH CHECK
| WITH NOCHECK provides an execution time check of existing data for a new or newly enabled constraint. InterSystems TSQL does not specifically support that, although InterSystems SQL will check e xisting data against a new constraint.

The Sybase PARTITION BY clause is not supported.

ALTER TABLE...ALTER COLUMN fieldname datatype can change the data type of an existing field. This command
completes without error when the specified datatype is the same as the field’ s existing data type.

ALTER TABLE...DROP [COLUMN] fieldname can drop a defined field or a comma-separated list of defined fields.
The keyword DELETE is a synonym for the keyword DROP.

–

Sybase: the COLUMN keyword is not permitted, the CONSTRAINT keyword is required: ALTER TABLE...DROP fieldname , CONSTRAINT constraint

– MSSQL: the COLUMN keyword is required, the CONSTRAINT keyword is optional: ALTER TABLE...DROP

COLUMN fieldname , constraint

ALTER TABLE...DROP [CONSTRAINT] constraintname can drop a constraint from a field. The keyword DELETE
is a synonym for the keyword DROP.

–

Sybase: the CONSTRAINT keyword is required.

– MSSQL: the CONSTRAINT keyword is optional.

ALTER TABLE...ADD CONSTRAINT...DEFAULT syntax does not create a field constraint. Instead, it performs
the equivalent of an ALTER TABLE...ALTER COLUMN...DEFAULT statement. This means that InterSystems IRIS establishes the specified field def defined, this “constraint” cannot be subsequently dropped or changed.

ault as the field property’ s initial expression. Because no field constraint is

CHECK | NOCHECK CONSTRAINT is not supported by InterSystems IRIS TSQL. Specifying this CHECK or NOCHECK keyword generates an error message.

- 4.1.3 DROP TABLE

- Deletes a table definition.

- DROP TABLE [IF EXISTS] tablename

- Deletes a table definition. You can delete both regular tables and temporary tables. (Temporary table names begin with a '#' character.) DROP TABLE ignores a nonexistent temporary table name and completes without error.

Specify tablename as described in Table References.

If tablename has an associated view, you must delete the view before you can delete the table.

The IF EXISTS clause is parsed but ignored.

#### 4.1.4 CREATE INDEX

Creates an index for a specified table or vie w.

CREATE [UNIQUE] INDEX indexname ON tablename (fieldname [,fieldname2])

You can create an index on a field or a comma-separated list of fields.

You can create an index on the IDKEY (which is treated as a clustered index), on an IDENTITY field (which create an index on the %%ID field), on the Primary K ey, or on other fields.

Specify tablename as described in Table References.

The UNIQUE keyword creates a unique value constraint index for the specified field(s).

The following Transact-SQL features are parsed, but ignored:

- The CLUSTERED/NONCLUSTERED keywords. Other than the IDKEY, which is implicitly treated as a clustered index, InterSystems TSQL does not support clustered indexes.

- The ON dbspace clause.

- The ASC/DESC keywords.

- The INCLUDE clause.

- WITH clause options, such as WITH FILLFACTOR=n or WITH DROP_EXISTING=ON. The comma-separated list of WITH clause options can optionally be enclosed in parentheses.

- The ON file group or IN dbspace-name clause.

The following Transact-SQL features are not currently supported:

- Sybase index types.

- The IN dbspace clause.

- The NOTIFY integer clause.

- The LIMIT integer clause.

- Using a function name as an alternative to a field name.

The ALTER INDEX statement is not supported.

#### 4.1.5 DROP INDEX

Deletes an index definition. You can delete a single index or a comma-separated list of indexes, using either of the following
syntax forms:

DROP INDEX tablename.indexname [,tablename.indexname]

DROP INDEX indexname ON tablename [WITH (...)] [,indexname ON tablename [WITH (...)] ]

tablename is the name of the table containing the indexed field. Specify Specifying a #temptable is only permitted when the current namespace is part of a shard cluster.

tablename as described in Table References.

indexname is the name of the index. It can be a regular identifier or a quoted identifier

.

The WITH (...) clause, with any value within the parentheses, is accepted by syntax checking for compatibility, but is not validated and performs no operation.

The IF EXISTS clause is not supported.

#### 4.1.6 CREATE TRIGGER

Creates a statement-level trigger.

CREATE TRIGGER triggername ON tablename
[WITH ENCRYPTION]
{FOR | AFTER | INSTEAD OF} {INSERT | DELETE | UPDATE}
[WITH APPEND]
[NOT FOR REPLICATION] AS tsql_trigger_code

You can create a trigger for one event (INSERT), or for a comma-separated list of events (INSERT,UPDATE).

Specify tablename as described in Table References.

The FOR, AFTER, and INSTEAD OF keywords are synonyms. A trigger is always pulled after the event operation is performed.

If there are multiple triggers for the same event or comma-separated list of events they are executed in the order the triggers were created.

The following clauses are parsed but ignored: WITH ENCRYPTION, WITH APPEND, NOT FOR REPLICATION.

InterSystems TSQL does not support row-level triggers.

You cannot include a CREATE TRIGGER statement in CREATE PROCEDURE code.

#### 4.1.7 DROP TRIGGER

Deletes a trigger definition.

DROP TRIGGER [owner.]triggername

#### 4.1.8 CREATE VIEW

Creates a view definition.

CREATE VIEW [owner.]viewname
[WITH {ENCRYPTION | SCHEMABINDING | VIEW_METADATA}]
AS select_statement [WITH CHECK OPTION]

A viewname must be a unique TSQL identifier . Specify viewname as described in Table References. If the view already exists, an SQLCODE -201 error is issued. A viewname can be a delimited identifier . For example, CREATE VIEW
Sample.[Name/Age View].

By default, the view fields ha ve the same names as the fields in the SELECT table. To specify different names for the view
fields, specify field aliases in the SELECT statement. These aliases are used as the view field names:

TSQL

CREATE VIEW NameAgeV
AS SELECT Name AS FullName,Age AS Years FROM Sample.Person

You can specify a WITH clause with a single keyword or a comma-separated list of keywords. For example: WITH SCHEMABINDING, ENCRYPTION, VIEW_METADATA. The ENCRYPTION, SCHEMABINDING, and VIEW_META- DATA keywords are parsed but ignored.

The select_statement can only include an ORDER BY clause if this clause is paired with a TOP clause. If you wish to include all of the rows in the view, you can pair an ORDER BY clause with a TOP ALL clause. You can include a TOP

clause without an ORDER BY clause. However, if you include an ORDER BY clause without a TOP clause, an SQLCODE -143 error is generated.

The select_statement can contain a UNION or UNION ALL.

The optional WITH CHECK OPTION clause prevents an update through the view that makes the record inaccessible to that view. It does this by checking the WITH clause in the SELECT statement. WITH CHECK OPTION binds to InterSystems SQL using the default of CASCADE.

The ALTER VIEW statement is not supported.

#### 4.1.9 DROP VIEW

Deletes a view definition.

DROP VIEW viewname [,viewname2 [,...] ]

You can delete a single view, or a comma-separated list of views. Specify viewname as described in Table References.

DROP VIEW is not an all-or-nothing operation. It deletes existing views in the list of views until it encounters a nonexistent
view in the list. At that point the delete operation stops with an SQLCODE -30 error.

The IF EXISTS clause is not supported.

#### 4.1.10 CREATE DATABASE

CREATE DATABASE syntax is parsed to provide compatibility. No functionality is provided.

CREATE DATABASE dbname

Only this basic CREATE DATABASE syntax is parsed.

Sybase additional CREATE DATABASE clauses are not supported.

MSSQL attach a database and create a database snapshot syntax options are not supported.

The ALTER DATABASE statement is not supported.

#### 4.1.11 DROP DATABASE

DROP DATABASE syntax is parsed to provide compatibility. No functionality is provided.

DROP DATABASE dbname

### 4.2 Data Management Language (DML) Statements

- TSQL can resolve an unqualified table name using a schema search path for a single DML statement in Dynamic SQL.

- TSQL cannot resolve an unqualified table name using a schema search path for multiple DML statements in Dynamic SQL. This includes multiple statements such as an explicit BEGIN TRANSACTION followed by a single DML statement.

#### 4.2.1 DELETE

Deletes rows of data from a table. Both DELETE and DELETE ... FROM are supported:

DELETE FROM tablename WHERE condition

DELETE FROM tablename FROM matchtablename WHERE tablename.fieldname = matchtablename.fieldname

Only very simple theta joins are supported (the FROM table clause is transformed into nested subqueries).

You can specify how DELETE executes by providing one or more execution options as a comma-separated list. You
provide these options in a comment with the following specific syntax:

/* IRIS_DELETE_HINT: option,option2 */

Where option can be the following: %NOCHECK, %NOFPLAN, %NOINDEX, %NOLOCK, %NOTRIGGER, %PROFILE, %PROFILE_ALL. Refer to the InterSystems SQL DELETE command for details.

You can provide optimization hints to the DELETE FROM clause as a comma-separated list. You provide these hints in
a comment with the following specific syntax:

/* IRIS_DELETEFROM_HINT: hint,hint2 */

Where hint can be the following: %ALLINDEX, %FIRSTTABLE tablename, %FULL, %INORDER, %IGNOREINDICES, InterSystems SQL FROM clause for details.

The following table_hints are parsed but ignored: FASTFIRSTROW, HOLDINDEX, INDEX(name), NOLOCK, PAGLOCK, SHARED, TABLOCK, TABLOCKX, UPDLOCK, XLOCK. Table hints can be optionally preceded by the WITH keyword, and, if WITH is specified, optionally enclosed in parentheses. A list of table hints can be separated by either commas or blank spaces.

DELETE sets the @@ROWCOUNT system variable to the number of rows deleted, and the @@IDENTITY system
variable to the IDENTITY value of the last row deleted.

A DELETE that has a @@ROWCOUNT of more than 100,000 automatically invokes UPDATE STATISTICS to optimize the table for future queries.

You can use either DELETE or TRUNCATE TABLE to delete all rows from a table. DELETE sets @@ROWCOUNT
to the number of rows deleted. TRUNCATE TABLE is more efficient, b ut does not preserve the number of rows deleted;
it sets @@ROWCOUNT to -1. DELETE does not reset the RowID counter and other row counters; TRUNCATE TABLE
resets these counters.

The following options are not supported:

- MSSQL rowset functions.

- MSSQL OPTION clause.

#### 4.2.2 INSERT

Inserts rows of data into a table. The following syntactic forms are supported:

INSERT [INTO] tablename (fieldname[,fieldname2[,...]]) VALUES (list_of_values)

INSERT [INTO] tablename (fieldname[,fieldname2[,...]]) SELECT select_list

The INTO keyword is optional. Specify tablename as described in Table References.

For the VALUES syntax, the VALUES keyword is mandatory for both MSSQL and Sybase. The (fieldname ) list is optional if the list_of_values lists all user-specified fields in the order defined in the table. If field names are specified, the list_of_values is a comma-separated list of values that matches the list of field names in number and data type.

You can specify how INSERT executes by providing one or more execution options as a comma-separated list. You provide
these options in a comment with the following specific syntax:

/* IRIS_INSERT_HINT: option,option2 */

Where option can be the following: %NOCHECK, %NOFPLAN, %NOINDEX, %NOLOCK, %NOTRIGGER, %PROFILE, %PROFILE_ALL. Refer to the InterSystems SQL INSERT command for details.

The following table_hints are parsed but ignored: FASTFIRSTROW, HOLDINDEX, INDEX(name), NOLOCK, PAGLOCK, SHARED, TABLOCK, TABLOCKX, UPDLOCK, XLOCK. Table hints can be optionally preceded by the WITH keyword, and, if WITH is specified, optionally enclosed in parentheses. A list of table hints can be separated by either commas or blank spaces.

INSERT sets the @@ROWCOUNT system variable to the number of rows inserted, and the @@IDENTITY system
variable to the IDENTITY value of the last row inserted.

An INSERT that has a @@ROWCOUNT of more than 100,000 automatically invokes UPDATE STATISTICS to optimize the table for future queries.

The following options are not supported:

- (fieldname) DEFAULT VALUES or (fieldname) VALUES (DEFAULT). A field’ s default value is used when the field is not specified in the

- INSERT statement.

- (fieldname) EXECUTE procname.

- Sybase insert load option clauses: LIMIT, NOTIFY, SKIP, or START ROW ID.

- Sybase insert select load option clauses: WORD SKIP, IGNORE CONSTRAINT, MESSAGE LOG, or LOG
DELIMITED BY.

Sybase LOCATION clause.

- MSSQL INSERT TOP clause.

- MSSQL rowset functions.

#### 4.2.3 UPDATE

Updates values of existing rows of data in a table.

UPDATE tablename SET fieldname=value [,fieldname2=value2[,...]]
[FROM tablename [,tablename2]] WHERE fieldname=value

UPDATE tablename SET fieldname=value[,fieldname2=value2[,...]]
WHERE [tablename.]fieldname=value

These syntactic forms are vendor-specific:

- Sybase: the optional FROM keyword syntax is used to specify an optional table (or joined tables) used in a condition. Only very simple theta joins are supported (the FROM table clause is transformed into nested subqueries).

- MSSQL: the tablename.fieldname syntax is used to specify an optional table used in a condition.

The value data type and length must match the fieldname defined data type and length. A value can be a expression that resolves to a literal value or it can be the NULL keyword. It cannot be the DEFAULT keyword.

Specify tablename as described in Table References.

UPDATE supports the use of a local variable on the left-hand-side of a SET clause. This local variable can be either instead
of a field name or in addition to a field name. The following example shows a SET to a field name, a SET to a local v ariable,
and a SET to both a field name and a local v ariable:

UPDATE table SET x=3,@v=b,@c=Count=Count+1

You can specify how UPDATE executes by providing one or more execution options as a comma-separated list. You
provide these options in a comment with the following specific syntax:

/* IRIS_UPDATE_HINT: option,option2 */

Where option can be the following: %NOCHECK, %NOFPLAN, %NOINDEX, %NOLOCK, %NOTRIGGER, %PROFILE, %PROFILE_ALL. Refer to the InterSystems SQL UPDATE command for details.

You can provide optimization hints to the UPDATE FROM clause as a comma-separated list. You provide these hints in
a comment with the following specific syntax:

/* IRIS_UPDATEFROM_HINT: hint,hint2 */

Where hint can be the following: %ALLINDEX, %FIRSTTABLE tablename, %FULL, %INORDER, %IGNOREINDICES, InterSystems SQL FROM clause for details.

The following table_hints are parsed but ignored: FASTFIRSTROW, HOLDINDEX, INDEX(name), NOLOCK, PAGLOCK, SHARED, TABLOCK, TABLOCKX, UPDLOCK, XLOCK. Table hints can be optionally preceded by the WITH keyword, and, if WITH is specified, optionally enclosed in parentheses. A list of table hints can be separated by either commas or blank spaces.

UPDATE sets the @@ROWCOUNT system variable to the number of rows updated, and the @@IDENTITY system
variable to the IDENTITY value of the last row updated.

An UPDATE that has a @@ROWCOUNT of more than 100,000 automatically invokes UPDATE STATISTICS to optimize the table for future queries.

The following Dynamic SQL example shows a simple UPDATE operation:

ObjectScript

SET sql=9
SET sql(1)="CREATE TABLE #mytest (MyId INT PRIMARY KEY,"
SET sql(2)="LastName VARCHAR(20) CONSTRAINT nonull_lname NOT NULL,"
SET sql(3)="FirstName VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT '***TBD***')"
SET sql(4)="INSERT INTO #mytest(MyId,LastName,FirstName) VALUES (1224,'Smith','John')"
SET sql(5)="INSERT INTO #mytest(MyId,LastName) VALUES (1225,'Jones')"
SET sql(6)="INSERT INTO #mytest(MyId,LastName) VALUES (1226,'Brown')"
SET sql(7)="UPDATE #mytest SET FirstName='Fred' WHERE #mytest.LastName='Jones'"
SET sql(8)="SELECT FirstName,LastName FROM #mytest ORDER BY LastName"
SET sql(9)="DROP TABLE #mytest"
SET statement=##class(%SQL.Statement).%New()
SET statement.%Dialect="MSSQL"
SET status=statement.%Prepare(.sql)
WRITE status,!
SET result=statement.%Execute()
DO result.%Display()

The following options are not supported:

- Sybase ORDER BY clause.

- MSSQL OPTION clause.

- MSSQL TOP clause.

- MSSQL rowset functions.

#### 4.2.4 READTEXT

Reads data from a stream field.

READTEXT tablename.fieldname textptr offset size

The MSSQL READTEXT statement returns stream data from a field of a table. It requires a v alid text pointer value, which
can be retrieved using the TEXTPTR function, as shown in the following example:

DECLARE @ptrval binary(16);
SELECT @ptrval = TEXTPTR(Notes) FROM Sample.Person
READTEXT Sample.Person.Notes @ptrval 0 0

The textptr must be declared as binary. A textptr is only defined for a te xt field that is not null. You can specify an initial non-null value for a text field using the INSERT statement.

The offset can be 0, a positive integer value, or NULL: 0 reads from the beginning of the text. A positive integer reads from
the offset position. NULL reads from the end of the text; that is, it completes successfully but returns no value.

The size can be 0 or a positive integer value, or NULL: 0 reads all characters from the offset position to the end of the text. A positive integer reads the size number of characters from the offset position. NULL completes successfully but returns no value.

The MSSQL HOLDLOCK keyword is parsed but ignored.

#### 4.2.5 WRITETEXT

Writes data to a stream field, replacing the e xisting data value.

WRITETEXT tablename.fieldname textptr value

The MSSQL WRITETEXT statement writes data to a stream field of a table. It requires a v alid text pointer value, which
can be retrieved using the TEXTPTR function, as shown in the following example:

TSQL

DECLARE @ptrval binary(16);
SELECT @ptrval = TEXTPTR(Notes) FROM Sample.Person
WRITETEXT Sample.Person.Notes @ptrval 'This is the new text value'

The textptr must be declared as binary. A textptr is only defined for a te xt field that is not null. You can specify an initial non-null value for a text field using the INSERT statement.

The MSSQL BULK keyword is not supported.

The MSSQL WITH LOG keyword phrase is parsed but ignored.

#### 4.2.6 UPDATETEXT

Updates data in a stream field.

UPDATETEXT tablename.fieldname textptr offset deletelength value

The MSSQL UPDATETEXT statement updates stream data from a field of a table. It requires a v alid text pointer value, which can be retrieved using the TEXTPTR function. The following example updates the contents of the Notes stream
data field by inserting the w ord ‘New’ at the beginning of the existing data value:

DECLARE @ptrval binary(16);
SELECT @ptrval = TEXTPTR(Notes) FROM Sample.Person
WRITETEXT Sample.Person.Notes @ptrval 0 0 'New'

The textptr must be declared as binary. A textptr is only defined for a te xt field that is not null. You can specify an initial non-null value for a text field using the INSERT statement.

The offset can be an integer value or NULL: 0 inserts the value at the beginning of the existing text. NULL inserts the value at the end of the existing text.

The deletelenth can be an integer value or NULL: 0 or NULL deletes no existing characters from the offset position before inserting the value. A positive integer deletes that number of existing characters from the offset position before inserting the value.

The MSSQL BULK keyword is not supported.

The MSSQL WITH LOG keyword phrase is parsed but ignored.

#### 4.2.7 TRUNCATE TABLE

Deletes all of the data from a table.

TRUNCATE TABLE tablename

Invokes the InterSystems SQL TRUNCATE TABLE command, which deletes all rows from the specified table and resets the RowId (ID), IDENTITY, and SERIAL (%Counter) row counters and the stream field OID counter v alues. TRUNCATE
TABLE does not preserve the number of rows deleted; it sets @@ROWCOUNT to -1.

You can specify how TRUNCATE TABLE executes by providing one or more execution options as a comma-separated
list. You provide these options in a comment with the following specific syntax:

/* IRIS_DELETE_HINT: option,option2 */

Where option can be the following: %NOCHECK, %NOLOCK. Refer to the InterSystems SQL TRUNCATE TABLE for details.

### 4.3 Query Statements

#### 4.3.1 SELECT

SELECT [DISTINCT | ALL]
[TOP [(]{ int | @var | ? | ALL}[)]]

select-item {,select-item}

[ [fieldname=IDENTITY(n)] INTO [#]copytable] [FROM tablename [[AS] t-alias] [,tablename2 [[AS] t-alias2]] ] [[WITH] [(] tablehint=val [,tablehint=val] [)] ] [WHERE condition-expression] [GROUP BY scalar-expression] [HAVING condition-expression] [ORDER BY item-order-list [ASC | DESC] ]

The above SELECT syntax is supported. The following features are not supported:

- TOP nn PERCENT or TOP WITH TIES

- OPTION

- WITH CUBE

- WITH ROLLUP

- GROUP BY ALL

- GROUP WITH

- COMPUTE clause

- FOR BROWSE TOP nn specifies the number of ro ws to retrieve. InterSystems TSQL supports TOP nn with a integer, ?, local variable, or the keyword ALL. The TOP argument can be enclosed in parentheses TOP (nn). These parentheses are retained, preventing preparser substitution. If SET ROWCOUNT specifies fe wer rows than TOP nn, the SET ROWCOUNT value is used.
The following Dynamic SQL example shows the use of TOP with a local variable:

ObjectScript

SET sql=3
SET sql(1)="DECLARE @var INT"
SET sql(2)="SET @var=4"
SET sql(3)="SELECT TOP @var Name,Age FROM Sample.Person"
SET statement=##class(%SQL.Statement).%New()
SET statement.%Dialect="MSSQL"
SET status=statement.%Prepare(.sql)
SET result=statement.%Execute()
DO result.%Display()

The select-item list can contain the following:

- field names, functions, and e xpressions

- the $IDENTITY pseudo-field name, which al ways returns the RowID value, regardless of the field name assigned to
the RowID.

- an asterisk: SELECT * is supported. The asterisk means to select all fields in the specified table. You can qualify the asterisk with the table name or table alias: SELECT mytable.*.

- a subquery

- stream fields. A SELECT on a stream field returns the OREF (object reference) of the opened stream object.

An INTO clause can be used to copy data from an existing table into a new table. By default, SELECT creates the INTO table with the same field names and data types as the fields selected from the source table. The INTO table cannot already
exist. This INTO table can be a permanent table, or a temporary table, as shown in the following examples:

TSQL

SELECT Name INTO Sample.NamesA_G FROM Sample.Person WHERE name LIKE '[A-G]%'

TSQL

SELECT Name INTO #MyTemp FROM Sample.Person WHERE name LIKE '[A-G]%'
SELECT * FROM #MyTemp

You can specify a different name for an INTO table field by using a field alias, as sho wn in the following example:

TSQL

SELECT Name AS Surname INTO Sample.NamesA_G FROM Sample.Person WHERE name LIKE '[A-G]%'

An INTO clause can contain an optional IDENTITY field definition, which adds the specified field as an (with n precision) to the table created by the INTO clause.

IDENTITY field

An INTO clause cannot be used when the SELECT is a subquery or is part of a UNION.

The FROM clause is not required. A SELECT without a FROM clause can be used to assign a value to a local variable,
as follows:

TSQL

DECLARE @myvar INT
SELECT @myvar=1234
PRINT @myvar

The FROM clause supports table hints with either of the following syntactic forms:

FROM tablename (INDEX=indexname)
FROM tablename INDEX (indexname)

Table hints can be optionally preceded by the WITH keyword, and optionally enclosed in parentheses. A list of table hints can be separated by either commas or blank spaces. The following table hints are parsed but ignored: FASTFIRSTROW, HOLDINDEX, NOLOCK, PAGLOCK, READCOMMITTED, READPAST, READUNCOMMITTED, REPEAT- ABLEREAD, ROWLOCK, SERIALIZABLE, SHARED, TABLOCK, TABLOCKX, UPDLOCK, XLOCK.

You can provide optimization hints to the SELECT FROM clause as a comma-separated list. You provide these hints in
a comment with the following specific syntax:

/* IRIS_SELECTFROM_HINT: hint,hint2 */

Where hint can be the following: %ALLINDEX, %FIRSTTABLE tablename, %FULL, %INORDER, %IGNOREINDICES, InterSystems SQL FROM clause for details.

A WHERE clause can use AND, OR, and NOT logic keywords. It can group multiple search conditions using parentheses.
The WHERE clause supports the following search conditions:

- Equality comparisons: = (equals), <> (not equals), < (less than), > (greater than), <= (less than or equals), >= (greater than or equals).

- IS NULL and IS NOT NULL comparisons.

- BETWEEN comparisons: Age BETWEEN 21 AND 65 (inclusive of 21 and 65); Age NOT BETWEEN 21 AND 65
(exclusive of 21 and 65). BETWEEN is commonly used for a range of numeric values, which collate in numeric order. However, BETWEEN can be used for a collation sequence range of values of any data type. It uses the same collation type as the field it is matching ag ainst. By default, string data types collate as not case-sensitive.

- IN comparisons: Home_State IN ('MA','RI','CT').

- LIKE and NOT LIKE comparisons, specified as a quoted string. The comparison string can contain wildcards: _ (any
single character); % (any string); [abc] (any value in the set specified as a list of items); [a-c] (an y value in the set
specified as a range of items). InterSystems TSQL does not support the ^ wildcard. A LIKE comparison can include an ESCAPE clause, such as the following: WHERE CategoryName NOT LIKE 'D\_%' ESCAPE '\'.

- EXISTS comparison check: used with a subquery to test whether the subquery evaluates to the empty set. For example
SELECT Name FROM Sample.Person WHERE EXISTS (SELECT LastName FROM Sample.Employee
WHERE LastName='Smith'). In this example, all Names are returned from Sample.Person if a record with Last-
Name='Smith' exists in Sample.Employee. Otherwise, no records are returned from Sample.Person.

- ANY and ALL comparison check: used with a subquery and an equality comparison operator. The SOME keyword is a synonym for ANY.

WHERE clause and HAVING clause comparisons are not case-sensitive.

A HAVING clause can be specified after a GR OUP BY clause. The HAVING clause is like a WHERE clause that can operate on groups, rather than on the full data set. HAVING and WHERE use the same comparisons. This is shown in the
following example:

TSQL

SELECT Home_State, MIN(Age) AS Youngest,
AVG(Age) AS AvgAge, MAX(Age) AS Oldest
FROM Sample.Person
GROUP BY Home_State HAVING Age < 21 ORDER BY Youngest

The following Dynamic SQL example selects table data into a result set:

ObjectScript

SET sql=7
SET sql(1)="CREATE TABLE #mytest (MyId INT PRIMARY KEY,"
SET sql(2)="LastName VARCHAR(20),"
SET sql(3)="FirstName VARCHAR(20))"
SET sql(4)="INSERT INTO #mytest(MyId,LastName,FirstName) VALUES (1224,'Smith','John')"
SET sql(5)="INSERT INTO #mytest(MyId,LastName,FirstName) VALUES (1225,'Jones','Wilber')"
SET sql(6)="SELECT FirstName,LastName FROM #mytest"
SET sql(7)="DROP TABLE #mytest"
SET statement=##class(%SQL.Statement).%New()
SET statement.%Dialect="MSSQL"
SET status=statement.%Prepare(.sql)
SET result=statement.%Execute()
DO result.%Display()

The following Dynamic SQL example selects a single field v alue into a local variable:

ObjectScript

SET sql=9
SET sql(1)="CREATE TABLE #mytest (MyId INT PRIMARY KEY,"
SET sql(2)="LastName VARCHAR(20),"
SET sql(3)="FirstName VARCHAR(20))"
SET sql(4)="INSERT INTO #mytest(MyId,LastName,FirstName) VALUES (1224,'Smith','John')"
SET sql(5)="INSERT INTO #mytest(MyId,LastName,FirstName) VALUES (1225,'Jones','Wilber')"
SET sql(6)="DECLARE @nam VARCHAR(20)"
SET sql(7)="SELECT @nam=LastName FROM #mytest"
SET sql(8)="PRINT @nam"
SET sql(9)="DROP TABLE #mytest"
SET statement=##class(%SQL.Statement).%New()
SET statement.%Dialect="MSSQL"
SET status=statement.%Prepare(.sql)
DO statement.%Execute()

An ORDER BY clause can specify ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order. The default is ascending. Unlike Inter-
Systems SQL, an ORDER BY may be used in subqueries and in queries that appear in expressions. For example:

TSQL

SET @var = (SELECT TOP 1 name FROM mytable ORDER BY name)

#### 4.3.2 JOIN

JOIN (equivalent to INNER JOIN), INNER JOIN, and LEFT JOIN supported. Parentheses can be used to rationalize parsing of multiple joins.

Sybase legacy *= and =* outer joins are supported.

#### 4.3.3 UNION

A union of two (or more) SELECT statements is supported. InterSystems TSQL supports UNION and UNION ALL. If you specify UNION ALL, only the first SELECT can specify an INTO table. This INTO table can be a defined table, or a temporary table generated from the SELECT field list.

#### 4.3.4 FETCH Cursor

The OPEN, FETCH, CLOSE, and DEALLOCATE commands are mainly supported. The following features are not
supported:

- OPEN/FETCH/CLOSE @local

- FETCH followed by any qualifier other than NEXT (the qualifier can be omitted).

- Note that DEALLOCATE is supported, but that, by design, it generates no code.

### 4.4 Flow of Control Statements

#### 4.4.1 IF

Executes a block of code if a condition is true.

The IF command is supported with four syntactic forms:

IF...ELSE syntax:

IF condition statement [ELSE statement]

IF...THEN...ELSE single-line syntax:

IF condition THEN statement [ELSE statement]

ELSEIF...END IF syntax:

IF condition THEN statements
{ELSEIF condition THEN statements}
[ELSE statements]
END IF

ELSE IF (SQL Anywhere) syntax:

IF condition THEN statement
{ELSE IF condition THEN statement}
[ELSE statement]

The first syntactic form is the TSQL standard format. No THEN keyword is used. You may use white space and line breaks freely. To specify more than one statement in a clause you must use BEGIN and END keywords to demarcate the block of
statements. The ELSE clause is optional. This syntax is shown in the following example:

Flow of Control Statements

ObjectScript

SET sql=4
SET sql(1)="DECLARE @var INT"
SET sql(2)="SET @var=RAND()"
SET sql(3)="IF @var<.5 PRINT 'The Oracle says No'"
SET sql(4)="ELSE PRINT 'The Oracle says Yes' "
SET statement=##class(%SQL.Statement).%New()
SET statement.%Dialect="MSSQL"
SET status=statement.%Prepare(.sql)
SET result=statement.%Execute()
DO result.%Display()

The second syntactic form is single-line syntax. The THEN keyword is required. A line break restriction requires that IF condition THEN statement all be on the same line, though only the first k eyword of the statement must be on that line. Otherwise, you may use white space and line breaks freely. To specify more than one statement in a clause you must use BEGIN and END keywords to demarcate the block of statements. The ELSE clause is optional. This syntax is shown
in the following example:

ObjectScript

SET sql=3
SET sql(1)="DECLARE @var INT "
SET sql(2)="SET @var=RAND() "
SET sql(3)="IF @var<.5 THEN PRINT 'No' ELSE PRINT 'Yes' "
SET statement=##class(%SQL.Statement).%New()
SET statement.%Dialect="MSSQL"
SET status=statement.%Prepare(.sql)
SET result=statement.%Execute()
DO result.%Display()

The third syntactic form provides an ELSEIF clause. You can specify zero, one, or more than one ELSEIF clauses, each with its own condition test. Within an IF, ELSEIF, or ELSE clause you can specify multiple statements. BEGIN and END keywords are permitted but not required. A line break restriction requires a line break between IF condition THEN and the first statement. Otherwise, you may use white space and line breaks freely. The ELSE clause is optional. The END
IF keyword clause is required. This syntax is shown in the following example:

ObjectScript

SET sql=14
SET sql(1)="DECLARE @var INT "
SET sql(2)="SET @var=RAND() "
SET sql(3)="IF @var<.2 THEN "
SET sql(4)="PRINT 'The Oracle' "
SET sql(5)="PRINT 'says No' "
SET sql(6)="ELSEIF @var<.4 THEN "
SET sql(7)="PRINT 'The Oracle' "
SET sql(8)="PRINT 'says Possibly' "
SET sql(9)="ELSEIF @var<.6 THEN "
SET sql(10)="PRINT 'The Oracle' "
SET sql(11)="PRINT 'says Probably' "
SET sql(12)="ELSE PRINT 'The Oracle' "
SET sql(13)="PRINT 'says Yes' "
SET sql(14)="END IF"
SET statement=##class(%SQL.Statement).%New()
SET statement.%Dialect="MSSQL"
SET status=statement.%Prepare(.sql)
SET result=statement.%Execute()
DO result.%Display()

The fourth syntactic form is compatible with SQL Anywhere. It provides an ELSE IF clause (note space between keywords). You can specify zero, one, or more than one ELSE IF clauses, each with its own condition test. To specify more than one statement in a clause you must use BEGIN and END keywords to demarcate the block of statements. You may use white
space and line breaks freely. The ELSE clause is optional. This syntax is shown in the following example:

ObjectScript

SET sql=6
SET sql(1)="DECLARE @var INT "
SET sql(2)="SET @var=RAND() "
SET sql(3)="IF @var<.2 THEN PRINT 'The Oracle says No'"
SET sql(4)="ELSE IF @var<.4 THEN PRINT 'The Oracle says Possibly'"
SET sql(5)="ELSE IF @var<.6 THEN PRINT 'The Oracle says Probably'"
SET sql(6)="ELSE PRINT 'The Oracle says Yes'"
SET statement=##class(%SQL.Statement).%New()
SET statement.%Dialect="MSSQL"
SET status=statement.%Prepare(.sql)
SET result=statement.%Execute()
DO result.%Display()

#### 4.4.2 WHILE

Repeatedly executes a block of code while a condition is true.

WHILE condition BEGIN statements END

The BREAK keyword exits the WHILE loop.

The CONTINUE keyword immediately returns to the top of the WHILE loop.

The BEGIN and END keywords are required if statements is more than one command.

The following example returns four result sets, each containing a pair of records in ascending ID sequence:

DECLARE @n INT;
SET @n=0;
WHILE @n<8 BEGIN
SELECT TOP 2 ID,Name FROM Sample.Person WHERE ID>@n
SET @n=@n+2
END;

#### 4.4.3 CASE

Returns a value from the first match of multiple specified v

alues.

CASE expression WHEN value THEN rtnval [WHEN value2 THEN rtnval2] [...] [ELSE rtndefault]
END

The WHEN value must be a simple value. It cannot be a boolean expression.

The ELSE clause is optional. If no WHEN clause is satisfied and the ELSE clause is not pro vided, the CASE statement returns expression as NULL.

For example:

SQL

SELECT CASE Name WHEN 'Fred Rogers' THEN 'Mr. Rogers'
WHEN 'Fred Astare' THEN 'Ginger Rogers' ELSE 'Somebody Else' END
FROM Sample.Person

The returned value does not have to match the data type of expression.

CASE parses but ignores WHEN NULL THEN rtnval cases.

#### 4.4.4 GOTO and Labels

InterSystems TSQL supports the GOTO command and labels. A label must be a valid TSQL identifier followed by a colon (:). A GOTO reference to a label does not include the colon.

Assignment Statements

#### 4.4.5 WAITFOR

Used to delay execution until a specific elapse of time or clock time.

WAITFOR DELAY timeperiod WAITFOR TIME clocktime

timeperiod is the amount of time to wait before resuming execution, expressed as 'hh:mm[:ss[.fff]] Thus WAITFOR DELAY
'00:00:03' provides a time delay of 3 seconds; WAITFOR DELAY '00:03' provides a time delay of 3 minutes;
WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:00.9' provides a time delay of nine-tenths of a second. Note that the fractional second divider is a period, not a colon.

clocktime is the time at which to resume execution, expressed as 'hh:mm[:ss[.fff]], using a 24-hour clock. Thus WAITFOR
TIME '14:35:00' resumes execution at 2:35pm; WAITFOR TIME '00:00:03' resumes execution at 3 seconds after
midnight.

The following options are not supported:

- Sybase CHECK EVERY clause.

- Sybase AFTER MESSAGE BREAK clause.

- MSSQL RECEIVE clause.

### 4.5 Assignment Statements

#### 4.5.1 DECLARE

Declares the data type for a local variable.

DECLARE @var [AS] datatype [ = initval]

Only the form which declares local variables is supported; cursor variables are not supported. The AS keyword is optional.
Unlike InterSystems SQL, you must declare a local variable before you can set it.

@var can be any local variable name. Sybase local variable names are case-sensitive. MSSQL local variable names are not case-sensitive.

The datatype can be any valid data type, such as CHAR(12) or INT. TEXT, NTEXT, and IMAGE data types are not allowed. For further details on data types, see TSQL Constructs.

The optional initval argument allows you to set the initial value of the local variable. You can set it to a literal value or to any of the following: NULL, USER, CURRENT DATE (or CURRENT_DATE), CURRENT TIME (or CURRENT_TIME), CURRENT TIMESTAMP (or CURRENT_TIMESTAMP), or CURRENT_USER. The DEFAULT and CUR- RENT_DATABASE keywords are not supported. Alternatively, you can set the value of a local value using the SET
command or the SELECT command. For example:

DECLARE @c INT;
SELECT @c=100;

You can specify multiple local variable declarations as a comma-separated list. Each declaration must have its own data
type and (optionally) its own initial value:

DECLARE @a INT=1,@b INT=2,@c INT=3

#### 4.5.2 SET

Assigns a value to a local variable or an environment setting.

Used to assign a value to a local variable:

TSQL

DECLARE @var CHAR(20)
SET @var='hello world'

Used to set an environment setting:

SET option ON

These settings have immediate effect at parse time, whether inside a stored procedure or not. The change persists until another SET command alters it – even if the SET is made inside a stored procedure, and accessed outside the SP or in another SP.

The following SET environment settings are supported:

- SET ANSI_NULLS Permitted values are SET ANSI_NULLS ON and SET ANSI_NULLS OFF. If ANSI_NULLS OFF, a=b is true if (a=b OR (a IS NULL) AND (b IS NULL)). See the ANSI_NULLS TSQL system-wide configuration setting.

- SET DATEFIRST integer specifies which day is treated as the first day of the week. Permitted v 7, with 1=Monday and 7=Sunday. The default is 7.

- alues are 1 through

- SET IDENTITY_INSERT Permitted syntax is SET IDENTITY_INSERT [[database-name.] schema-name.] table-name. This variable applies to the current process and cannot be set on linked tables. Therefore, to use this option you should define a procedure in TSQL to perform both the SET IDENTITY_INSERT and the INSERT, then link the procedure and execute the procedure in InterSystems IRIS via the gateway.

- SET NOCOUNT Permitted values are SET NOCOUNT ON and SET NOCOUNT OFF. When set to ON, messages indicating the number of rows affected by a query are suppressed. This can have significant performance benefits.

- SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER Permitted values are SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON and SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER OFF. When SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER is on, double quotes are parsed as delimiting a quoted identifier . When SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER is off, double quotes are parsed as delimiting a string literal. The preferable delimiters for string literals are single quotes. See the QUOTED_IDENTIFIER TSQL system-wide configuration setting.

SET ROWCOUNT Set to an integer. Affects subsequent SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statements to limit the number of rows affected. In a SELECT statement, ROWCOUNT takes precedence over TOP: if ROWCOUNT is
less than TOP, the ROWCOUNT number of rows is returned; if TOP is less than ROWCOUNT, the TOP number of
rows is returned. ROWCOUNT remains set for the duration of the process or until you revert it to default behavior. To revert to default behavior, SET ROWCOUNT 0. If you specify a fractional value, ROWCOUNT is set to the next larger integer.

- SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL See Transaction Statements below.

The following SET environment setting is parsed, but ignored:

- SET TEXTSIZE integer

Transaction Statements

### 4.6 Transaction Statements

InterSystems TSQL provides support for transactions, including named transaction names. It does not support savepoints. Distributed transactions are not supported.

#### 4.6.1 SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL

Supported for the following forms only:

- SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED

- SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED.

READ VERIFIED and other options are not supported.

Sybase SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL n integer option codes (0, 1, 2, 3) are not supported.

#### 4.6.2 BEGIN TRANSACTION

Begins the current transaction.

BEGIN TRAN [name] BEGIN TRANSACTION [name]

Initiates a transaction. The optional name argument can be used to specify a named transaction, also known as a savepoint.
The name value must be supplied as a literal; it cannot be a variable.

You can issue multiple BEGIN TRANSACTION statements to create multiple nested transactions. You can use the @@trancount special variable to determine the current transaction level. Each transaction level must be resolved by a COMMIT statement or a ROLLBACK statement.

Note:

A Data Management Language (DML) statement that is within an explicit transaction cannot resolve an unqualified table name using a schema search path.

#### 4.6.3 COMMIT TRANSACTION

Commits the current transaction.

COMMIT
COMMIT TRAN
COMMIT TRANSACTION
COMMIT WORK

These four syntactical forms are functionally identical; the COMMIT keyword, as specified belo w, refers to any of these
syntactical forms. A COMMIT statement commits all work completed during the current transaction, resets the transaction level counter, and releases all locks established. This completes the transaction. Work committed cannot be rolled back.

If multiple BEGIN TRANSACTION statements have created nested transactions, COMMIT completes the current nested transaction. A transaction is defined as the operations since and including the BEGIN TRANSACTION statement. A COMMIT restores the transaction level counter to its state immediately prior to the BEGIN TRANSACTION statement that initialized the transaction. You can use the @@trancount special variable to determine the current transaction level.

A COMMIT cannot specify a named transaction. If you specify a transaction name as part of a COMMIT statement, the presence of this name is parsed without issuing an error, but the transaction name is not validated and it is ignored.

Sybase performs no operation and does not issue an error if a COMMIT is issued when not in a transaction.

#### 4.6.4 ROLLBACK TRANSACTION

Rolls back the specified transaction or all current transactions.

ROLLBACK [name] ROLLBACK TRAN [name] ROLLBACK TRANSACTION [name] ROLLBACK WORK [name]

These four syntactical forms are functionally identical; the ROLLBACK keyword, as specified belo w, refers to any of
these syntactical forms. The optional name argument specifies a named transaction, as specified by a BEGIN
TRANSACTION name statement. The name value must be supplied as a literal; it cannot be a variable.

A ROLLBACK rolls back a transaction, undoing work performed but not committed, decrementing the transaction level counter, and releasing locks. It is used to restore the database to a previous consistent state.

- A ROLLBACK rolls back all work completed during the current transaction (or series of nested transactions), resets the transaction level counter to zero and releases all locks. This restores the database to its state before the beginning of the outermost nested transaction.

- A ROLLBACK name rolls back all work done since the specified named transaction (sa vepoint) and decrements the transaction level counter by the number of savepoints undone. When all savepoints have been either rolled back or committed and the transaction level counter reset to zero, the transaction is completed. If the named transaction does not exist, or has already been rolled back, ROLLBACK rolls back the entire current transaction.

Sybase performs no operation and does not issue an error if a ROLLBACK is issued when not in a transaction.

#### 4.6.5 SAVE TRANSACTION

The SAVE TRANSACTION [savepoint-name] statement is parsed but ignored in InterSystems TSQL. It performs no operation.

#### 4.6.6 LOCK TABLE

Enables the current user to lock a table.

LOCK TABLE tablename IN {SHARE | EXCLUSIVE} MODE [WAIT numsecs | NOWAIT]

The LOCK TABLE statement locks all of the records in the specified table. You can lock a table in SHARE MODE or in EXCLUSIVE MODE. The optional WAIT clause specifies the number of seconds to w ait in attempting to acquire the table lock. The LOCK TABLE statement immediately releases any prior lock held by the current user on the specified table.

LOCK TABLE is only meaningful within a transaction. It locks the table for the duration of the current transaction. When not in a transaction, LOCK TABLE performs no operation.

Specify tablename as described in Table References. LOCK TABLE supports locking a single table; it does not support
locking multiple tables.

LOCK TABLE supports SHARE and EXCLUSIVE modes; it does not support WRITE mode.

LOCK TABLE does not support the WITH HOLD clause.

WAIT time is specified as an inte ger number of seconds; LOCK TABLE does not support WAIT time specified as clock
time.

### 4.7 Procedure Statements

The following standard Transact-SQL statements are supported.

#### 4.7.1 CREATE PROCEDURE / CREATE FUNCTION

Creates a named executable procedure.

CREATE PROCEDURE procname [[@var [AS] datatype [= | DEFAULT value] [,...]] [RETURNS datatype] [AS] code
CREATE PROC procname [[@var [AS] datatype [= | DEFAULT value] [,...]] [RETURNS datatype] [AS] code
CREATE FUNCTION procname [[@var [AS] datatype [= | DEFAULT value] [,...]] [RETURNS datatype] [AS] code

You can return a single scalar value result from either a PROCEDURE or a FUNCTION. OUTPUT parameters and default values are also supported. These commands convert the return type from a TSQL type declaration to an InterSystems IRIS type descriptor. Currently, result sets and tables can't be returned.

Supported as either CREATE PROCEDURE or CREATE PROC. CREATE FUNCTION is very similar to CREATE PROCEDURE, but the routine type argument value is "FUNCTION", rather than "PROCEDURE".

- Any statements can be used in a CREATE FUNCTION.

- The RETURN keyword is allowed in a CREATE PROCEDURE. If a procedure completes without invoking a RETURN or RAISERROR statement, it returns an integer value of 0.

- The WITH EXECUTE keyword clause is allowed in a CREATE PROCEDURE and CREATE FUNCTION. It must appear after the RETURN keyword.

A CREATE PROCEDURE can specify a formal parameter list. Formal parameters are specified as a comma-separated list. Enclosing parentheses are optional. The AS keyword between the parameter variable and its data type is optional.
Optionally, you can use the DEFAULT keyword or = symbol to assign a default value to a formal parameter; if no actual
parameter value is specified, this def ault value is used. In TSQL an input formal parameter has no keyword indicator; an
output formal parameter can be specified by the OUTPUT k eyword following the data type. Alternatively, these formal parameters can be prefaced by the optional keywords IN, OUT, or INOUT.

The following example shows the creation of the procedure AvgAge with two formal parameters:

TSQL

CREATE PROCEDURE AvgAge @min INT, @max INT
AS
BEGIN TRY
SELECT AVG(Age) FROM Sample.Person
WHERE Age > @min AND Age < @max
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
PRINT 'error!'
END CATCH

The following statement executes this procedure. In this case, the specified actual parameter v alues limit the averaging to
ages 21 through 65:

TSQL

EXEC AvgAge 20,66

The following example creates a procedure that returns the results of a division operation. The RETURNS keyword limits
the number of decimal digits in the return value:

CREATE PROCEDURE SQLUser.MyDivide @a INTEGER, @b INTEGER, OUT @rtn INTEGER RETURNS DECIMAL(2,3)
BEGIN
SET @rtn = @a / @b;
RETURN @rtn;
END

The following statement executes this procedure:

TSQL

SELECT SQLUser.MyDivide(7,3)

The following example shows the creation of procedure OurReply:

TSQL

CREATE PROCEDURE OurReply @var CHAR(16) DEFAULT 'No thanks' AS PRINT @var

When executed without a parameter, OurReply prints the default text (“No thanks”); when executed with a parameter
OurReply prints the actual parameter value specified in the EXEC statement.

Note that CREATE FUNCTION and CREATE PROCEDURE cannot be issued from a stored procedure.

The ALTER PROCEDURE statement is not supported.

##### 4.7.1.1 Importing a CREATE PROCEDURE

If imported TSQL source contains a CREATE PROC statement, then a class method containing the CREATE PROC source will be created. This class method is either placed in an existing class, or in a new class whose name is based on the schema and procedure name.

If the procedure already exists, the existing implementation is replaced. If a class matching the class name generated from the schema and procedure already exists, it is used if it was previously generated by the TSQL utility. If not, then a unique class name is generated, based on the schema and procedure name. The schema defaults to the default schema defined in the system configuration. The resulting class is compiled once the procedure has been successfully created.

If logging is requested, the source statements are logged along with the name of the containing class, class method, and the formal arguments generated. Any errors encountered by the process are also reported in the log. If errors are detected during
CREATE PROC processing and a new class was generated, that class is deleted.

#### 4.7.2 ALTER FUNCTION

Supported. The WITH EXECUTE keyword clause is supported.

#### 4.7.3 DROP FUNCTION

Deletes a function or a comma-separated list of functions.

DROP FUNCTION funcname [,funcname2 [,...] ]

The IF EXISTS clause is not supported.

#### 4.7.4 DROP PROCEDURE

Deletes a procedure or a comma-separated list of procedures.

DROP PROCEDURE [IF EXISTS] procname [,procname2 [,...] ]
DROP PROC [IF EXISTS] procname [,procname2 [,...] ]

The optional IF EXISTS clause suppresses errors if you specify a non-existent procname. If this clause is not specified, an
SQLCODE -362 error is generated if you specify a non-existent procname. DROP PROCEDURE is an atomic operation;
either all specified procedures are successfully deleted or none are deleted.

#### 4.7.5 RETURN

Halts execution of a query or procedure. Can be argumentless or with an argument. Argumentless RETURN must be used when exiting a TRY or CATCH block. When returning from a procedure, RETURN can optionally return an integer status code. If you specify no status code, it returns the empty string ("").

#### 4.7.6 EXECUTE

Executes a procedure, or executes a string of TSQL commands.

EXECUTE [@rtnval = ] procname [param1 [,param2 [,...] ] ]

EXECUTE ('TSQL_commands')

EXEC is a synonym for EXECUTE.

- EXECUTE procname can be used to execute a stored procedure. Parameters are supplied as a comma-separated list. This parameter list is not enclosed in parentheses. Named parameters are supported.

EXECUTE procname can optionally receive a RETURN value, using the EXECUTE @rtn=Sample.MyProc param1,param2 syntax.

EXECUTE procname is similar to the CALL statement, which can also be used to execute a stored procedure. CALL uses an entirely different syntax.

TSQL

CREATE PROCEDURE Sample.AvgAge @min INT, @max INT
AS
SELECT Name,Age,AVG(Age) FROM Sample.Person
WHERE Age > @min AND Age < @max
RETURN 99

TSQL

DECLARE @rtn INT;
EXECUTE @rtn=Sample.AvgAge 18,65
SELECT @rtn

If the specified procedure does not e xist, an SQLCODE -428 error (Stored procedure not found) is issued.

The WITH RECOMPILE clause is parsed, but ignored.

The following EXECUTE procname features are not supported: procedure variables, and procedure numbers (i.e.
';n').

- EXECUTE (TSQL commands) can be used to execute dynamic SQL. The TSQL command(s) are enclosed in parentheses. The TSQL commands to be executed are specified as a string enclosed in single quote characters. A TSQL command string can contain line breaks and white space. Dynamic TSQL runs in the current context.

TSQL

EXECUTE('SELECT TOP 4 Name,Age FROM Sample.Person')

or

TSQL

DECLARE @DynTopSample VARCHAR(200)
SET @DynTopSample='SELECT TOP 4 Name,Age FROM Sample.Person'
EXECUTE (@DynTopSample)

The following example shows an EXECUTE that returns multiple result sets:

TSQL

EXECUTE('SELECT TOP 4 Name FROM Sample.Person
SELECT TOP 6 Age FROM Sample.Person')

#### 4.7.7 EXECUTE IMMEDIATE

Executes a string of TSQL commands.

EXECUTE IMMEDIATE "TSQL_commands"

The WITH QUOTES ON/OFF, WITH ESCAPES ON/OFF, and WITH RESULT SET ON/OFF Boolean options are not supported.

#### 4.7.8 CALL

Executes a procedure.

[@var = ] CALL procname ([param1 [,param2 [,...] ] ])

The CALL statement is functionally identical to the EXECUTE procname statement. It differs syntactically.

The procedure parameters are optional. The enclosing parentheses are mandatory.

The optional @var variable receives the value returned by the RETURN statement. If execution of the stored procedure does not conclude with a RETURN statement, @var is set to 0.

The following example calls a stored procedure, passing two input parameters. It receives a value from the procedure’s
RETURN statement:

DECLARE @rtn INT @rtn=CALL Sample.AvgAge(18,34)
SELECT @rtn

### 4.8 Other Statements

#### 4.8.1 CREATE USER

CREATE USER creates a new user.

CREATE USER username

Executing this statement creates an InterSystems IRIS user with its password set to the specified user name. You can then use the Management Portal System Administration interface to change the password. You cannot explicitly set a password using CREATE USER.

User names are not case-sensitive. InterSystems TSQL and InterSystems SQL both use the same set of defined user names. InterSystems IRIS issues an error message if you try to create a user that already exists.

By default, a user has no privileges. Use the GRANT command to give privileges to a user.

Other Statements

The DROP USER statement is not supported.

#### 4.8.2 GRANT

Grants privileges to a user or list of users.

GRANT privilegelist ON tablelist TO granteelist

GRANT EXECUTE ON proclist TO granteelist
GRANT EXEC ON proclist TO granteelist

- privilegelist: a single privilege or a comma-separated list of privileges. The available privileges are SELECT, INSERT,
DELETE, UPDATE, REFERENCES, and ALL PRIVILEGES. ALL is a synonym for ALL PRIVILEGES. The ALTER
privilege is not supported directly, but is one of the privileges granted by ALL PRIVILEGES.

- tablelist: a single table name (or view name) or a comma-separated list of table names and view names. Specify a table name as described in Table References.

- proclist: a single SQL procedure or a comma-separated list of SQL procedures. All listed procedures must exist, otherwise an SQLCODE -428 error is returned.

- granteelist: a single grantee (user to be assigned privileges) or a comma-separated list of grantees. A grantee can be a user name, "PUBLIC" or "*". Specifying * grants the specified pri vileges to all existing users. A user created using
CREATE USER initially has no privileges. Specifying a non-existent user in a comma-separated list of grantees has
no effect; GRANT ignore that user and grants the specified pri vileges to the existing users in the list.

Specifying privileges for specified fields is not supported.

The WITH GRANT OPTION clause is parsed but ignored.

Granting a privilege to a user that already has that privilege has no effect and no error is issued.

#### 4.8.3 REVOKE

Revokes granted privileges from a user or list of users.

REVOKE privilegelist ON tablelist FROM granteelist CASCADE

REVOKE EXECUTE ON proclist FROM granteelist
REVOKE EXEC ON proclist FROM granteelist

Revoking a privilege from a user that does not have that privilege has no effect and no error is issued.

See GRANT for further details.

#### 4.8.4 PRINT

Displays the specified te xt to the current device.

PRINT expression [,expression2 [,...]]

An expression can be a literal string enclosed in single quotes, a number, or a variable or expression that resolves to a string or a number. You can specify any number of comma-separated expressions.

PRINT does not support the Sybase arg-list syntax. A placeholder such as %3! in an expression string is not substituted for, but is displayed as a literal.

#### 4.8.5 RAISERROR

RAISERROR errnum 'message' RAISERROR(error,severity,state,arg) WITH LOG

Both syntactic forms (with and without parentheses) are supported. Both spellings, RAISERROR and RAISEERROR, are supported and synonymous. RAISERROR sets the value of @@ERROR to the specified error number and error message and invokes the %SYSTEM.Error.FromXSQL() method.

The Sybase-compatible syntax (without parentheses) requires an errnum error number, the other arguments are optional.

TSQL

RAISERROR 123 'this is a big error'
PRINT @@ERROR

A RAISERROR command raises an error condition; it is left to the user code to detect this error. However, if RAISERROR
appears in the body of a TRY block, it transfers control to the paired CATCH block. If RAISERROR appears in a CATCH block it transfers control either to an outer CATCH block (if it exists) or to the procedure exit. RAISERROR does not trigger an exception outside of the procedure. It is up to the caller to check for the error.

When an AFTER statement level trigger executes a RAISEERROR, the returned %msg value contains the errnum and message values as message string components separated by a comma: %msg="errnum,message".

The Microsoft-compatible syntax (with parentheses) requires an error (either an error number or a quoted error message). If you do not specify an error number, it defaults to 50000. The optional severity and state arguments take integer values.

TSQL

RAISERROR('this is a big error',4,1) WITH LOG
PRINT @@ERROR

#### 4.8.6 UPDATE STATISTICS

Optimizes query access for a specified table. The specified table can be a standard table or a # temporary table (see CREATE TABLE for details.) InterSystems IRIS passes the specified table name ar gument to the
$SYSTEM.SQL.Stats.Table.GatherTableStats() method for optimization. UPDATE STATISTICS calls
GatherTableStats(). All other UPDATE STATISTICS syntax is parsed for compatibility only and ignored. In a batch or stored procedure, only the first UPDATE STATISTICS statement for a given table collects table statistics. For further details, see Table Statistics for Query Optimizer.

If an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE has a @@ROWCOUNT of more than 100,000, executing that command automatically invokes an UPDATE STATISTICS (TuneTable) of the table.

If the TSQL TRACE configuration option is set, the trace log file will contain records of the tables that were tuned.

#### 4.8.7 USE database

Supported, also an extension: USE NONE to select no database. Effective at generation-time, persists as long as the transform object exists (e.g. in the shell or loading a batch).

InterSystems Extensions

### 4.9 InterSystems Extensions

TSQL supports a number of InterSystems extensions to Transact-SQL. To allow for the inclusion of these InterSystemsonly statements in portable code, InterSystems TSQL also supports a special form of the single-line comment: two hyphens followed by a vertical bar. This operator is parsed as a comment by Transact-SQL implementations, but is parsed as an executable statement in InterSystems TSQL.

TSQL includes the following InterSystems extensions:

#### 4.9.1 OBJECTSCRIPT

This extension allows you to include ObjectScript code or InterSystems SQL code in the compiled output. It takes one or more lines of InterSystems code inside curly brackets.

The following Dynamic SQL example uses OBJECTSCRIPT because TSQL does not support the InterSystems SQL
%STARTSWITH predicate:

SET myquery = "OBJECTSCRIPT {SELECT Name FROM Sample.Person "
_"WHERE Name %STARTSWITH 'A'}"
SET tStatement = ##class(%SQL.Statement).%New(,,"Sybase")
WRITE "language mode set to ",tStatement.%Dialect,!
SET qStatus = tStatement.%Prepare(myquery)
IF qStatus'=1 {
WRITE "%Prepare failed:"
DO $System.Status.DisplayError(qStatus)
QUIT
}
SET rset = tStatement.%Execute()
DO rset.%Display()
WRITE !,"End of data"

The following Dynamic SQL example uses OBJECTSCRIPT to include ObjectScript code in a TSQL routine:

SET tempDDL="CREATE TABLE Sample.MyTest(Name VARCHAR(40),Age INTEGER)"

SET newtbl=2
SET newtbl(1)=tempDDL
SET newtbl(2)="OBJECTSCRIPT
DO $SYSTEM.SQL.Stats.Table.GatherTableStats(""Sample.MyTest"")
WRITE ""TuneTable Done"",!"
SET tStatement = ##class(%SQL.Statement).%New(,,"Sybase")
WRITE "language mode set to ",tStatement.%Dialect,!
SET qStatus = tStatement.%Prepare(.newtbl)
IF qStatus'=1 {
WRITE "%Prepare failed:"
DO $System.Status.DisplayError(qStatus)
QUIT
}
SET rset = tStatement.%Execute()
DO rset.%Display()
WRITE !,"End of data"

Note that in the above example the WRITE command specifies a ne w line (,!); this is necessary because the
OBJECTSCRIPT extension does not issue a new line following execution.

#### 4.9.2 IMPORTASQUERY

This extension forces a stored procedure to be imported as a query rather than as a class method. This is useful for stored procedures that contain only an EXEC statement, because InterSystems IRIS cannot otherwise determine at import whether such a stored procedure is a query or not.

Settings are used to tailor the behavior of the compiler and colorizer. The TSQL configuration options are part of the standard InterSystems IRIS® data platform configuration.

InterSystems IRIS supports the following TSQL settings:

- DIALECT

- ANSI_NULLS

- CASEINSCOMPARE (String comparison is not case-sensitive.)

- QUOTED_IDENTIFIER

- Equal Literal Replacement

- These values are used to set the corresponding ^%SYS("tsql","SET",...) global array values.

You can view and modify these settings using the InterSystems IRIS Management Portal and/or the %SYSTEM.TSQL Get and Set class methods.

- Go into the InterSystems IRIS Management Portal. Go to System Administration, Configuration, SQL and Object Settings, TSQL Compatibility. Here you can specify the DIALECT (Sybase or MSSQL, default is Sybase), and turn on or off the ANSI_NULLS, CASEINSCOMPARE, and QUOTED_IDENTIFIER settings.

If you change one or more configuration settings, this is indicated by an asterisk (*) in the upper left-hand corner of the screen immediately following the Management Portal path. For example, System > Configuration > TSQL Settings (configuration settings)*. You must press the Save button for configuration changes to tak e effect.

- Invoke the $SYSTEM.TSQL.CurrentSettings() method to display the settings:

ObjectScript

DO ##class(%SYSTEM.TSQL).CurrentSettings()

You can use %SYSTEM.TSQL class methods to get or set these settings. These methods take a dialect string and change both the current dialect and the specified setting. There are not separate settings for each TSQL dialect. For example, changing CaseInsCompare changes this configuration setting for both Sybase and MSSQL.

You can also change InterSystems IRIS configuration settings to be more compatible with TSQL and to provide better
performance. The following configurable options are described on this page:

- Save cached query source

- Data collation and string truncation

- Timestamp data types and time precision

- Settings for temporary databases

### 5.1 DIALECT

The DIALECT configuration option allo ws you to select the Transact-SQL dialect. The available options are Sybase and
MSSQL. The default is Sybase. You can return the current setting using $SYSTEM.TSQL.GetDialect(). This option is
set system-wide using the InterSystems IRIS Management Portal or by using the $SYSTEM.TSQL.SetDialect() method:

ObjectScript

WRITE ##class(%SYSTEM.TSQL).SetDialect("Sybase")

This method returns the prior Dialect setting.

If DIALECT=MSSQL: a DECLARE statement binds host variable values.

If DIALECT=Sybase: host variable values are refreshed for each cursor OPEN.

Note:

You can also set InterSystems SQL to handle Transact-SQL source code by overriding the InterSystems SQL
default:

To set the Transact-SQL dialect in InterSystems Dynamic SQL.

To set the Transact-SQL dialect in the Management Portal SQL interface

To set the Transact-SQL dialect in the InterSystems SQL Shell.

To set the Transact-SQL dialect in JDBC.

### 5.2 ANSI_NULLS

The ANSI_NULLS configuration option allo ws you to specify whether comparisons to a null value return true or false. The default is OFF.

- ON: All comparisons to a null value evaluate to Unknown. For example, Age = Null returns false, even when Age is null. Null is unknown, so it is false/unknown to specify null=null.

- OFF: For each row, a comparison of a field v alue to NULL evaluates to True if the field does not contain a v alue. For example, Age = Null returns True for each row where Age does not contain a value. However, you cannot use ANSI_NULLS OFF to compare null values in two different fields. Comparisons of tw o fields that do not contain a value are always false. For example, Age = DateOfBirth and Age != DateOfBirth both return False when both fields do not contain a value.

You can determine the current ANSI_NULLS setting using %SYSTEM.TSQL class methods, or from the TSQLAnsiNulls
property, as follows:

ObjectScript

SET context=##class(%SYSTEM.Context.SQL).%New()
WRITE "ANSI_NULLS is = ",context.TSQLAnsiNulls

CASEINSCOMPARE

You can return the current setting using $SYSTEM.TSQL.GetAnsiNulls(). This method returns both the current default
dialect and the current ANSI_NULLS setting as a comma-separated string: for example, MSSQL, ON.

You can activate (ON) or deactivate (OFF) ANSI_NULLS system-wide using the InterSystems IRIS Management Portal
or by using the $SYSTEM.TSQL.SetAnsiNulls() method:

ObjectScript

WRITE ##class(%SYSTEM.TSQL).SetAnsiNulls("Sybase","OFF")

This method sets both the default dialect and the ANSI_NULLS setting, returns the prior settings as a comma-separated string: for example, MSSQL, ON.

### 5.3 CASEINSCOMPARE

The CASEINSCOMPARE setting specifies non-case-sensiti ve equality comparisons, such as 'A'='a'. The default is OFF. If this option is set to ON, the comparison operators = and <> operate without regard to case in most contexts. However,
there are a few contexts where such insensitivity does not apply:

- Where a comparison is the ON condition for a JOIN.

- Where either operand is a subquery.

These exceptions exist because InterSystems SQL does not accept the %SQLUPPER operator in these contexts.

You can determine the current CASEINSCOMPARE setting using %SYSTEM.TSQL class methods, or from the
TSQLCaseInsCompare property, as follows:

ObjectScript

SET context=##class(%SYSTEM.Context.SQL).%New()
WRITE "ANSI_NULLS is = ",context.TSQLCaseInsCompare

You can return the current setting using $SYSTEM.TSQL.GetCaseInsCompare(). You can activate (ON) or deactivate
(OFF) CASEINSCOMPARE system-wide using using the InterSystems IRIS Management Portal or by using the
$SYSTEM.TSQL.SetCaseInsCompare() method:

ObjectScript

WRITE ##class(%SYSTEM.TSQL).SetCaseInsCompare("Sybase","OFF")

This method returns the prior CASEINSCOMPARE setting.

### 5.4 QUOTED_IDENTIFIER

The QUOTED_IDENTIFIER configuration option allo ws you to select whether quoted identifiers are supported. The default is OFF (not supported). This option is set using the InterSystems IRIS Management Portal. When QUOTED_IDENTIFIER is on, double quotes are parsed as delimiting an identifier . When QUOTED_IDENTIFIER is off, double quotes are parsed as alternative delimiters for string literals. The preferable delimiters for string literals are single quotes.

You can determine the current QUOTED_IDENTIFIER setting using %SYSTEM.TSQL class methods, or from the
TSQLQuotedIdentifier property, as follows:

ObjectScript

SET context=##class(%SYSTEM.Context.SQL).%New()
WRITE "ANSI_NULLS is = ",context.TSQLQuotedIdentifier

You can return the current setting using $SYSTEM.TSQL.GetQuotedIdentifier() . You can activate (ON) or deactivate
(OFF) QUOTED_IDENTIFIER system-wide using using the InterSystems IRIS Management Portal or by using the
$SYSTEM.TSQL.SetQuotedIdentifier() method:

ObjectScript

WRITE ##class(%SYSTEM.TSQL).SetQuotedIdentifier("Sybase","OFF")

This method returns the prior QUOTED_IDENTIFIER setting.

### 5.5 Equal Literal Replacement

The Equal Literal Replacement configuration option is set using a method; is not a vailable from the Management Portal.
It controls the behavior of the TSQL compiler. You can return the current setting using
$SYSTEM.TSQL.GetEqualLiteralReplacement(). The default is ON.

You can activate (ON) or deactivate (OFF) Equal Literal Replacement system-wide using the
$SYSTEM.TSQL.SetEqualLiteralReplacement() method:

ObjectScript

WRITE ##class(%SYSTEM.TSQL).SetEqualLiteralReplacement("Sybase","OFF")

Setting SetEqualLiteralReplacement("Sybase","OFF") means TSQL queries with a WHERE clause equal sign (=) predicate or an IN(...) predicate will not perform literal substitution for literal values on the left or right side of the equal sign, or for any literal value in the IN predicate. This can help the query optimizer choose a better plan when the condition includes fields that ha ve an outlier value.

### 5.6 TRACE

xecution of TSQL procedures. When a TSQL stored procedure The TRACE configuration option creates a log file of the e (method or system stored procedure) is compiled with TRACE active, running a TSQL procedure will log trace messages to the active tsql log file.

A separate tsql trace log file is created for each process from which TSQL procedures are run. Trace is activated system-
wide; trace log files are namespace-specific.

TRACE is not set using the Management Portal. This option is set system-wide using the $SYSTEM.TSQL.SetTrace()
method. No dialect is specified:

ObjectScript

WRITE ##class(%SYSTEM.TSQL).SetTrace("ON")

You can return the current setting using $SYSTEM.TSQL.GetTrace().

You can also activate (1) or deactivate (0) TRACE system-wide using the following ObjectScript command:

ObjectScript

SET ^%SYS("tsql","TRACE")=1

To return the current trace setting:

ObjectScript

WRITE ^%SYS("tsql","TRACE")

The TRACE log file records a timestamp for each operation, the elapsed time for each operation, a global references count and a %ROWCOUNT (where applicable). Note that TRUNCATE TABLE always returns a %ROWCOUNT of -1. If an operation involves sharded tables, the global references count is only for the process the procedure is executed on. Work sent to the other shards is not included in the global reference count.

The TRACE log file represents a temporary table using the internal temporary table name; it displays the corresponding
user-specified #T empTable name in a /* mytemptable */ comment.

The TRACE log file is created in your InterSystems IRIS instance in the mgr directory , in the subdirectory for the current namespace. It is named using the current process number. For example: IRIS/mgr/user/ tsql16392.log. The following is a
typical TRACE log file:

#### 5.6.1 Cached Query Source

To aid in debugging, it is also desirable to retain cached query source code as well as the generated cached queries. You
can configure this option as follo ws:

ObjectScript

SET status=$SYSTEM.SQL.Util.SetOption("CachedQuerySaveSource",1,.oldval)

### 5.7 Data Collation and String Truncation

The default collation for InterSystems SQL is SQLUPPER. This is not the best match for the collation order native to
TSQL.

Sybase supports several different collation sort orders. The default is binary. This default is described as follows: “Sorts all data according to numeric byte values for that character set. Binary order sorts all ASCII uppercase letters before lowercase letters. Accented or ideographic (multibyte) characters sort in their respective standards order, which may be arbitrary. All character sets have binary order as the default.”

This binary collating order best matches the InterSystems IRIS SQLSTRING collating order. Therefore, changing the SQL collation sequence from SQLUPPER to SQLSTRING is likely the best compatibility option, though it is not guaranteed to be correct for all characters.

- To set the default collation for the current namespace: SET
status=$$SetEnvironment^%apiOBJ("COLLATION","%Library.String","SQLSTRING")

- To set the default collation system-wide: SET ^%oddENV("collation","%Library.String")="SQLSTRING" SQLSTRING collation preserves trailing blank spaces in strings when data is loaded in the database. When these strings are processed by stored procedures, these trailing blank spaces can cause errors. It is therefore recommended that you
configure string data types to truncate strings when the y are read. You can configure string data types as follo ws:

ObjectScript

SET status=$$SetSysDatatypes^%SYS.CONFIG(,"CHAR","%Library.String(MAXLEN=1,TRUNCATE=1)")
SET status=$$SetSysDatatypes^%SYS.CONFIG(,"CHAR(%1)","%Library.String(MAXLEN=%1,TRUNCATE=1)")
SET status=$$SetSysDatatypes^%SYS.CONFIG(,"VARCHAR","%Library.String(MAXLEN=1,TRUNCATE=1)")
SET status=$$SetSysDatatypes^%SYS.CONFIG(,"VARCHAR(%1)","%Library.String(MAXLEN=%1,TRUNCATE=1)")
SET status=$$SetSysDatatypes^%SYS.CONFIG(,"VARCHAR(%1,%2)","%Library.String(MAXLEN=%1,TRUNCATE=1)")

### 5.8 Timestamp and Time Precision

The default timestamp data type for InterSystems SQL is %TimeStamp. If a TSQL database has many datetime fields (as is often the case with financial databases) using %PosixTime as the default timestamp data type can reduce the amount of disk space required, therefore increasing row access speed, both for reading and writing. You can configure timestamp data
types as follows:

ObjectScript

SET status=$$SetSysDatatypes^%SYS.CONFIG(,"DATETIME","%Library.PosixTime")
SET status=$$SetSysDatatypes^%SYS.CONFIG(,"DATETIME2","%Library.PosixTime")
SET status=$$SetSysDatatypes^%SYS.CONFIG(,"TIMESTAMP","%Library.PosixTime")

You should also configure the def ault time precision to the desired number of decimal places of precision, as shown in the
following example:

ObjectScript

SET status=$SYSTEM.SQL.Util.SetOption("DefaultTimePrecision",6,.oldval)

Settings for Temporary Databases

### 5.9 Settings for Temporary Databases

For improved performance, it may be advantageous to change temporary database settings and work database settings to remove standard checks. These changes may not be appropriate for all TSQL environments. Note that work tables are temporary in nature, but could survive from one stored procedure run to another.

This page describes TSQL functions supported by InterSystems IRIS® data platform.

### 6.1 ABS

ABS(num)

Returns the absolute value of num. Thus both 123.99 and –123.99 return 123.99.

### 6.2 ACOS

ACOS(float)

Arc cosine: returns the angle in radians whose cosine is float . Thus 1 returns 0.

### 6.3 ASCII

ASCII(char)

Returns the integer value corresponding to the first character in string char. Thus, ASCII('A') returns 65.

ASCII is functionally identical to UNICODE. The reverse of this function is CHAR.

### 6.4 ASIN

ASIN(float)

Arc sine: returns the angle in radians whose sine is float . Thus 1 returns 1.570796326...

### 6.5 ATAN

ATAN(float)

Arc tangent: returns the angle in radians whose tangent is float . Thus 1 returns .785398163...

### 6.6 AVG

AVG(numfield)
AVG(DISTINCT numfield)

Aggregate function: used in a query to return the average of the values in the numfield column. For example, SELECT AVG(Age) FROM Sample.Person. AVG(DISTINCT numfield) a verages the number of unique values in the numfield column. Fields with NULL are ignored.

### 6.7 CAST

CAST(expression AS datatype)

Returns the expression converted to the specified datatype. CAST can be used with any supported data type. For further details, refer to Data Types in the InterSystems SQL Reference. CAST supports user-defined data types created using the sp_addtype stored procedure.

When expression is a date value string, such as '2004–11–23' and datatype is TIMESTAMP or DATETIME, a time value of '00:00:00' is supplied.

When expression is a time value string, such as '1:35PM' and datatype is TIMESTAMP or DATETIME, the time is converted to a 24-hour clock, the AM or PM suffix is remo ved, a missing seconds interval is filled in with zeros, and the def ault date value of '1900–01–01' is supplied. Thus '1:35PM' is converted to '1900–01–01 13:35:00'.

When expression is a date value string, such as '2004–11–23' and datatype is DATE, the date is returned in InterSystems
IRIS $HOROLOG date format, such as 60703 (March 14, 2007).

InterSystems TSQL does not support data type XML. However, instead of generating an error during compilation, CAST(x AS XML) in SQL mode generates CAST(x AS VARCHAR(32767)). In procedure mode, CAST(x AS XML) does not generate any conversion.

See CONVERT.

### 6.8 CEILING

CEILING(num)

Returns the closest integer greater than or equal to num. Thus 123.99 returns 124, –123.99 returns –123.

The Sybase CEIL synonym is not supported.

CHAR

### 6.9 CHAR

CHAR(num)

Returns the character corresponding to the integer value num. Thus CHAR(65) returns A.

CHAR is functionally identical to NCHAR. The reverse of this function is ASCII.

### 6.10 CHAR_LENGTH / CHARACTER_LENGTH

CHAR_LENGTH(string)
CHARACTER_LENGTH(string)

Returns the number of characters in string.

### 6.11 CHARINDEX

CHARINDEX(seekstring,target[,startpoint])

Returns the position in target (counting from 1) corresponding to first character of the first occurrence of seekstring. You can use the optional startpoint integer to specify where to begin the search. The return value counts from the beginning of target, regardless of the startpoint. If startpoint is not specified, specified as 0, 1, or as a ne gative number, target is searched from the beginning. CHARINDEX returns 0 if seekstring is not found.

### 6.12 COALESCE

COALESCE(expression1,expression2,...)

Returns the first non-null e xpression from the specified list of e xpressions.

### 6.13 COL_NAME

COL_NAME(object_id,column_id)

Returns the name of the column. Can be used in procedure code or trigger code.

TSQL supports the two-argument form of this function. It does not support a third argument.

The following example returns the column name of the 4th column of Sample.Person:

ObjectScript

SET sql=2
SET sql(1)="SELECT 'column name'=COL_NAME(id,4) FROM Sample.Person"
SET sql(2)="WHERE id=OBJECT_ID('Sample.Person')"
SET statement=##class(%SQL.Statement).%New()
SET statement.%Dialect="MSSQL"
SET status=statement.%Prepare(.sql)
SET result=statement.%Execute()
DO result.%Display()

COL_NAME does not support the Sybase third argument.

### 6.14 CONVERT

CONVERT(datatype,expression [,style])

Returns the expression converted to the specified datatype.

- BIT: When datatype is BIT and expression is a boolean value: if the input value is a non-zero number, the result is 1. if the input value is 0, the result is 0. If the input value is the string 'TRUE' (case insensitive), the result is 1. If the input value is the string 'FALSE' (case insensitive), the result is 0. If the input value is NULL, the result is NULL. Any other input value generates an SQLCODE -141 error.

- CHAR: When the length of CHAR is not specified, con verts to a length of 30 characters.

- DATETIME: When datatype is datetime or timestamp:

– When expression is a date value string, such as '2004–11–23', a time value of '00:00:00' is supplied.

– When expression is a time value string, such as '1:35PM' and datatype is datetime or timestamp, the time is converted to a 24-hour clock, the AM or PM suffix is remo ved, a missing seconds interval is filled in with zeros, and the default date value of '1900–01–01' is supplied. Thus '1:35PM' is converted to '1900–01–01 13:35:00'.

– When expression is the empty string or a string of one or more blank spaces, CONVERT returns '1900–01–01

00:00:00'.

By default DATETIME data type is mapped to %Library.TimeStamp. CONVERT also supports data type mapping of DATETIME to %Library.PosixTime.

CONVERT supports the DATETIME2 data type. InterSystems IRIS maps DATETIME2 to system-defined DDL
mapping %Library.TimeStamp. This mapping is supplied with new installs; if you are using an upgrade install, you
may need to create this mapping.

CONVERT supports user-defined data types created using the sp_addtype stored procedure.

The optional style argument is used to specify a date/time format when converting a datetime or timestamp value to a string. By specifying various style codes you can return a dates and times in a variety of different formats. The available style codes are 100 through 116, 120 through 123, 126, 130 and 131, 136 through 140. (the corresponding codes 0 through 7
and 10 through 40 return the same values with two-digit years); The default style for a datetime is 0:

mon dd yyyy hh:mmAM

The following are some of the supported datetime styles for Sybase:

COS

## 15 / 115 = format dd/[yy]yy/mm
## 16 / 116 = format mon dd yyyy HH:mm:ss
## 22 / 122 = format [yy]yy/mm/dd HH:mm AM (or PM) 23 / 123 = format [yy]yy-mm-ddTHH:mm:ss
## 36 / 136 = format hh:mm:ss.zzzzzzAM(PM) 37 / 137 = format hh:mm.ss.zzzzzz
## 38 / 138 = format mon dd [yy]yy hh:mm:ss.zzzzzzAM(PM)
## 39 / 139 = format mon dd [yy]yy HH:mm:ss.zzzzzz 40 / 140 = format yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss.zzzzzz

The 20 & 21 (120 & 121) style codes return the ODBC timestamp format; 20 truncates to whole seconds, 21 returns fractional
seconds:

yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss.fff

For further details, refer to the functionally identical InterSystems SQL CONVERT function in the InterSystems SQL Reference.

contain the following wildcard characters:

Character

Description

%

_

[xyz]

[a-z]

Zero or more characters. For example, '%a%' returns the position of the first occurrence of 'a' in string, including 'a' as the first character in string.

Any single character. For example, '_l%' returns 1 if string begins with a substring such as 'Al', 'el', and 'il'.

Any single character from the specified list of characters. For example, '[ai]l%' returns 1 if string begins with the substring 'al' or 'il', but not 'el' or 'Al'.

Any single character from the specified range of characters. For example, '%s[a-z]t%' matches 'sat', 'set', and 'sit'. A range must be specified in ascending ASCII sequence.

The caret (^) character is a not a wildcard character; if included within square brackets it is treated as a literal. A pattern
commonly consists of a search string enclosed in percent (%) characters '%Chicago%' indicating that the entire string should be searched.

PATINDEX is supported for sharded, parallel, and linked table queries.

### 6.57 PI

If length is 0, num is rounded to an integer. If the length argument is omitted, it defaults to 0. If length is a negative integer, num is rounded to the left of the decimal point. A third argument is not accepted by ROUND.

### 6.67 RTRIM

RTRIM(string)

Removes trailing blanks from string.

If string consists entirely of blank spaces, the dialect determines behavior:

- Sybase: returns NULL.

- MSSQL: returns the empty string.

See LTRIM.

### 6.68 SCOPE_IDENTITY

Returns the last identity value inserted into an IDENTITY column in the same scope. However, the last IDENTITY is not limited to the scope of the current procedure. Therefore, you should only use SCOPE_IDENTITY when you know that a statement within the current procedure has generated an IDENTITY value. For example, SCOPE_IDENTITY should be used after an INSERT command in the same procedure.

The following Dynamic SQL example returns the IDENTITY value from the second INSERT:

SIGN

ObjectScript

SET sql=6
SET sql(1)="CREATE TABLE #mytest (MyId INT IDENTITY(1,1),"
SET sql(2)="Name VARCHAR(20))"

Returns a string of length characters. If the integer length is equal to or greater than the number of characters in the numeric num (including decimal point and sign characters), STR returns num converted to a string and padded with leading blanks to make the resulting string of length characters.

If the optional integer precision is specified, num is truncated to the specified number of decimal digits before string conversion. If precision is omitted, num is truncated to its integer portion. If precision is larger than the number of decimal digits, num is padded with trailing zeros before string conversion.

If length is omitted, it defaults to 10. If length is less than the number of characters in num (after adjustment by precision) a dummy string consisting of all asterisks of length number of characters is returned.

### 6.75 STUFF

STUFF(string,start,length,replace)

Returns string with length number of characters removed and the replace string inserted. The point of removal and insertion is specified by the start integer, counting from the beginning of string. If length is 0, no characters are removed. If replace is the empty string, no characters are inserted.

If start is greater than the number of characters in string, no value is returned. If start is 1, length number of characters are removed from the beginning of string and the replace string inserted. If start is 0, length minus 1 number of characters are removed from the beginning of string and the replace string inserted.

If length is greater than or equal to the number of characters in string, the replace string is returned. The replace string length is not limited by the length of string or length.

### 6.76 SUBSTRING

SUBSTRING(string,start,length)

Returns a substring of string beginning at the location start for the length number of characters. If start is greater than the length of string, or if length is 0, no string is returned.

### 6.77 SUM

TEXTVALID('table.field',textpointer)

Takes an internal pointer to an image or text column from TEXTPTR, and compares it to a specified in table.field . Returns
## 1 if the pointer points to the specified

table.field . Otherwise, returns 0.

### 6.83 UNICODE

UNICODE(char)

Unsupported Functions

### 7.1 Local Variables

By default, TSQL local variables are specified using an at sign (@) prefix, for e default to also allow PLAINLOCALS, TSQL local variables specified without an at sign (@) prefix. F or example, myvar.

xample, @myvar. You can override this

#### 7.1.1 Declaring a Local Variable

A local variable must be declared (using DECLARE or as a formal parameter) before use. A variable name must be a valid identifier . Local variable names are not case-sensitive. The declaration must specify a data type, though strict data typing is not enforced in InterSystems TSQL. For a list of supported data types, see TSQL Constructs.

The DECLARE command has the following syntax:

DECLARE @var [AS] datatype [ = initval]

If declaring variables is inconvenient, you can switch this check off using the NDC setting. However, cursors must be declared, even if NDC is used.

Stored procedure arguments are automatically declared as local variables.

#### 7.1.2 Setting a Local Variable

A local variable can be set using either the SET command or the SELECT command. A local variable can be displayed using either the PRINT command or the SELECT command. The following Dynamic SQL examples show two local
variables being declared, set, and displayed:

ObjectScript

SET myquery = 3
SET myquery(1) = "DECLARE @a CHAR(20),@b CHAR(20) "
SET myquery(2) = "SET @a='hello ' SET @b='world!' "
SET myquery(3) = "PRINT @a,@b"
SET tStatement = ##class(%SQL.Statement).%New(,,"MSSQL")
SET qStatus = tStatement.%Prepare(.myquery)
IF qStatus'=1 { WRITE "%Prepare failed",$System.Status.DisplayError(qStatus) QUIT}
SET rset = tStatement.%Execute()
DO rset.%Display()

ObjectScript

SET myquery = 3
SET myquery(1) = "DECLARE @a CHAR(20),@b CHAR(20) "
SET myquery(2) = "SELECT @a='hello ', @b='world!'"
SET myquery(3) = "SELECT @a,@b"
SET tStatement = ##class(%SQL.Statement).%New(,,"MSSQL")
SET qStatus = tStatement.%Prepare(.myquery)
IF qStatus'=1 { WRITE "%Prepare failed",$System.Status.DisplayError(qStatus) QUIT}
SET rset = tStatement.%Execute()
DO rset.%Display()

#### 7.1.3 Initial and Default Values

By default, DECLARE initializes local variables to "" (SQL NULL). Optionally, you can specify an initial value (initval) for a local variable in the DECLARE command.

If a declared variable is set to the results of a scalar subquery, and the subquery returns no rows, InterSystems TSQL sets
the variable to "" (SQL NULL). This default is compatible with MS SQLServer; it is not compatible with Sybase.

#### 7.1.4 Plain Local Variables

By default, local variables require an @ prefix. Ho wever, you can specify plain locals, local variables that do not require
an @ prefix. The following command activates plain local variables:

TSQL

SET PLAINLOCALS ON

You must activate plain local variables before declaring these variables. With plain local variables activated you can declare both local variables with an @ prefix and local v ariables without an @ prefix. Ho wever, you cannot declare two variables that only differ by the @ prefix. F or example, @myvar and myvar are considered the same variable. When declaring, selecting, or printing a plain local variable, you can specify the same variable with or without the @ prefix.

Plain local variables follow all of the other TSQL variable conventions.

The following TSQL class method specifies PLAINLOCALS ON and declares and uses both an @ local v ariable and a
plain local variable:

ClassMethod Hello() As %String [Language=tsql,ReturnResultsets,SqlProc ]
{ SET PLAINLOCALS ON;
DECLARE @a CHAR(20),b CHAR(20);
SET @a='hello ' SET b='world!';
PRINT @a,b;
}

### 7.2 @@ Special Variables

TSQL special variables are identified by an @@ prefix. @@ v modified by user processes. @@ v ariables are global in scope (available to all processes). They are thus sometimes referred to elsewhere in the Transact-SQL literature as “global variables.” Because the term “global variable” is used widely in InterSystems IRIS and differs significantly in meaning, these TSQL @@ variables are referred to here as “special variables” to avoid confusion.

ariables are system-defined; the y cannot be created or

The following special variables are implemented. Invoking an unimplemented special variable generates a #5001 '@@nnn' unresolved symbol error or a #5002 <UNDEFINED> error. The corresponding ObjectScript and InterSystems SQL
generated code for each special variable is provided:

#### 7.2.1 @@ERROR

Contains the error number of the most recent TSQL error. 0 indicates that no error has occurred. A 0 value is returned when either SQLCODE=0 (successful completion) or SQLCODE=100 (no data, or no more data). To differentiate these two results, use @@SQLSTATUS.

ObjectScript SQLCODE

SQL :SQLCODE

#### 7.2.2 @@FETCH_STATUS

Contains an integer specifying the status of the last FETCH cursor statement. The available options are: 0=row successfully
fetched; –1=no data could be fetched; –2 row fetched is missing or some other error occurred. A value of –1 can indicate
that there is no data to FETCH, or that the fetch has reached the end of the data.

ObjectScript

SET myquery = "SELECT @@FETCH_STATUS AS FetchStat"
SET tStatement = ##class(%SQL.Statement).%New(,,"MSSQL")
SET qStatus = tStatement.%Prepare(myquery)
IF qStatus'=1 { WRITE "%Prepare failed",$System.Status.DisplayError(qStatus) QUIT}
SET rset = tStatement.%Execute()
DO rset.%Display()

The corresponding InterSystems SQL function is:

SQL

SELECT $TSQL_FETCH_STATUS()

ObjectScript $Case($Get(SQLCODE,0),0:0,100:-1,:-2)

SQL CASE :SQLCODE WHEN 0 THEN 0 WHEN 100 THEN –1 ELSE –2 END

#### 7.2.3 @@IDENTITY

Contains the IDENTITY field v alue of the most recently inserted, updated, or deleted row.

ObjectScript %ROWID

SQL :%ROWID

#### 7.2.4 @@LOCK_TIMEOUT

Contains an integer specifying the timeout value for locks, in seconds. Lock timeout is used when a resource needs to be exclusively locked for inserts, updates, deletes, and selects. The default is 10.

ObjectScript

SET myquery = "SELECT @@LOCK_TIMEOUT AS LockTime"
SET tStatement = ##class(%SQL.Statement).%New(,,"MSSQL")
SET qStatus = tStatement.%Prepare(myquery)
IF qStatus'=1 { WRITE "%Prepare failed",$System.Status.DisplayError(qStatus) QUIT}
SET rset = tStatement.%Execute()
DO rset.%Display()

The corresponding InterSystems SQL function is:

SQL

SELECT $TSQL_LOCK_TIMEOUT()

ObjectScript LOCK command

SQL SET OPTION LOCK_TIMEOUT

#### 7.2.5 @@NESTLEVEL

Contains an integer specifying the nesting level of the current process.

ObjectScript

SET rset = tStatement.%Execute()
DO rset.%Display()

The corresponding InterSystems SQL function is:

SQL

SELECT $TSQL_NESTLEVEL()

ObjectScript $STACK

#### 7.2.6 @@ROWCOUNT

Contains the number of rows affected by the most recent SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE command. A singlerow SELECT always returns a @@ROWCOUNT value of either 0 (no row selected) or 1.

When invoking an AFTER statement level trigger, the @@ROWCOUNT value upon entering the trigger is the @@ROWCOUNT immediately prior to the trigger. Rows affected within the scope of the trigger code are reflected in the @@ROWCOUNT value. Upon completion of the trigger code, @@ROWCOUNT reverts to the value immediately prior to the trigger invocation.

ObjectScript %ROWCOUNT

SQL :%ROWCOUNT

#### 7.2.7 @@SERVERNAME

Contains the InterSystems IRIS instance name.

ObjectScript

SET myquery = "SELECT @@SERVERNAME AS CacheInstance"
SET tStatement = ##class(%SQL.Statement).%New(,,"MSSQL")

SET qStatus = tStatement.%Prepare(myquery)
IF qStatus'=1 { WRITE "%Prepare failed",$System.Status.DisplayError(qStatus) QUIT}
SET rset = tStatement.%Execute()
DO rset.%Display()

The corresponding InterSystems SQL function is:

SQL

SELECT $TSQL_SQLSTATUS()

ObjectScript $Case($Get(SQLCODE,0),0:0,100:2,:1)

SQL CASE :SQLCODE WHEN 0 THEN 0 WHEN 100 THEN 2 ELSE 1 END

TSQL System Stored Procedures

InterSystems IRIS® data platform provides TSQL system stored procedures to help you administer and track database objects in your system. TSQL system stored procedures can be executed in any namespace and schema. The scope of all stored procedures is the current namespace.

Stored procedures are executed using the TSQL EXECUTE or EXEC command. For a stored procedure with a name such
as sp_xxx, this execute command can be explicit or implicit. Thus the following TSQL statements are functionally identical:

EXECUTE sp_addtype 'shortstr','varchar(6)','not null' EXEC sp_addtype 'shortstr','varchar(6)','not null' sp_addtype 'shortstr','varchar(6)','not null'

InterSystems TSQL supports the following system stored procedures:

- sp_addtype

- sp_droptype

- sp_procxmode

### 8.1 sp_addtype

This system stored procedure adds a user-defined data type.

sp_addtype typename, phystype [(length) | (precision [, scale])] [, "identity" | nulltype]

typename is a user-defined data type name. phystype is the physical datatype on which to base the user-defined datatype. You can optionally specify either IDENTITY or nulltype. The optional IDENTITY keyword specifies that the user -defined data type has the IDENTITY property, which by definition is NO T NULL. The optional nulltype specifies whether a column with this data type should have a NOT NULL constraint: options are NULL (allow nulls) and NOT NULL or NONULL (do not allow nulls).

A typename can only be used for table columns. A typename is defined within the current namespace; mapping of a typename
across namespaces is not supported.

The SQL compiler looks up type mapping in the DDL Datatype Mapping definitions in the system configuration before looking up in the typename table. Therefore, if you define a have a My_Type defined in the User DDL Datatype Mappings, the mapping of My_T ype comes from the User DDL Datatype Mapping definition.

typename using sp_addtype named My_Type, but you also

This lookup of typename is done at runtime, so typename does not need to be defined at DDL compile time.

TSQL System Stored Procedures

A data type defined using sp_addtype with a specified nulltype behaves as follows:

- If the DDL field specifies NULL, a v

- alue for the field is not required, e ven if sp_addtype specified NO T NULL.

- If the DDL field specifies NO T NULL, a value for the field is required, e ven if sp_addtype specified NULL.

- If the DDL field does not specify NULL or NO T NULL, a value for the field is required if sp_addtype specified NO T
NULL.

If the DDL field does not specify NULL or NO T NULL, a value for the field is not required if sp_addtype either specified NULL or did not specify a nulltype.

The following example creates the data type shortstr, which requires a value (NOT NULL) and this value must be six or
less characters:

EXEC sp_addtype 'shortstr','varchar(6)','not null'

### 8.2 sp_droptype

This system stored procedure deletes a user-defined data type.

sp_droptype typename

typename is a user-defined data type name defined within the current namespace.

See sp_addtype.

### 8.3 sp_procxmode (Sybase only)

This system stored procedure displays or changes the execution mode associated with stored procedures.

sp_procxmode [procname [, tranmode]]

procname is the name of a stored procedure. tranmode is the transaction execution mode: Values are "chained", "unchained" (the default), and "anymode".

When called with no arguments, sp_procxmode returns a result set of all procedures defined for the namespace, their user name and transaction mode (1=unchained). When called with just the procname argument, sp_procxmode returns the user name and transaction mode of the specified procedure.

The following tranmode values are supported:

- Chained: implicitly begins a transaction before any data-retrieval or modification statement: delete, insert, open, fetch, select, or update. You must still explicitly end the transaction with commit transaction or rollback transaction. A procedure defined to run in chained mode will set autocommit_of f at the beginning of the procedure, and restore the prior setting at the end of the procedure.

- Unchained: (the default) requires the user to explicit begin a transaction before any data-retrieval or modification statement. You must explicitly end the transaction with commit transaction or rollback transaction. A procedure defined to run in unchained mode will set autocommit_on at the beginning of the procedure, and restore the prior setting at the end of the procedure.

- Anymode: If the mode is not defined, or if it is defined as an ymode, no change is made to the autocommit setting.

sp_procxmode (Sybase only)

InterSystems IRIS does not support a SET [UN]CHAINED option to change process settings. The setting used is the current setting of the process's auto-commit mode.

InterSystems IRIS does not report an error if a procedure defined as chained is called by a process in autocommit_on mode, nor does it report an error if a procedure defined as unchained is called by a process in autocommit_of f mode.

The tranmode metadata is not part of the actual method definition. This means that changing the tranmode does not require a recompile. It also means that when exporting/importing classes containing TSQL (Sybase) stored procedures, the tranmode setting for the procedure is not exported with the class definition. Upon import, if a procedure needs to be defined in Chained mode, you must call EXEC sp_procxmode 'procname', 'chained' for the procedure.
