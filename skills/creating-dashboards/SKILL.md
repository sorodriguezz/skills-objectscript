# Creating Dashboards

### 1.1 Displaying Business Intelligence Dashboards

To access Business Intelligence dashboards from the Management Portal, click Analytics and then click User Portal.

Or use a supported browser (see Supported Web Browsers) and go to the following URL, using the <baseURL> for your
instance:

http://<baseURL>/csp/samples/_DeepSee.UserPortal.Home.zen

In either case, the right area then lists the available dashboards in this namespace. This area initially displays the items in
Covers View, as follows:

Introduction to Dashboards

When you hover the cursor over a cover, the system displays an arrow on the cover, as follows:

If you click the cover arrow, the system displays the dashboard. If you have permission to do so, you can then edit the dashboard.

For more information on using the User Portal, see Using Dashboards and the User Portal.

### 1.2 About Dashboards

A dashboard typically includes multiple widgets and controls, as in the following example:

About Dashboards

The left area of the dashboard displays two worklists. These are configurable areas you can use to display controls (such as the filters sho wn in the upper worklist) and other useful items (such as the recent items list shown in the lower worklist). (For information on using worklists, see Using Dashboards and the User Portal. For information on configuring them, see Implementing InterSystems Business Intelligence.)

This example dashboard also includes two widgets, which are both pivot table widgets. Note that a pivot table widget can display any kind of data source.

Dashboards can include other kinds of widgets, including meters and scorecards. A scorecard shows multiple rows of data
in a tabular format that also includes features such as value-dependent lamps and arrows. For example:

Introduction to Dashboards

A meter shows one or more values in graphical objects like the following:

### 1.3 Location of Dashboard Definitions

When you create a dashboard, its definition is a vailable within your IDE as a generated file with the e xtension .dashboard.dfi.
If you are using Visual Studio Code, you can access these pivot table definitions in the follo wing ways:

- Client-side editing: when a namespace is opened in the ObjectScript Explorer, view the .dfi files in the Other directory.

- Server-side editing: modify your workspace filters so that they show generated files and include the desired .dfi files.

Pivot table definitions and other Business Intelligence folder items are accessible in the same manner .

These definitions are not class definitions b For details, see Packaging Business Intelligence Elements into Classes.

ut can be copied and pasted into a special container class for easier deployment.

This page describes how to create and edit Business Intelligence dashboards.

For information on customizing covers for dashboards, see Using Dashboards and the User Portal.

### 2.1 Introduction to the Autosave Feature

The system provides an optional autosave feature, which can automatically save the state of the User Portal for each user,
for each dashboard. If the autosave feature is enabled for the User Portal:

- When you access the User Portal, the system displays that user interface as you last saw it.

- When you display a dashboard, the system displays that dashboard as you last saw it.

For information on this option, see Specifying Basic Settings. Note that there is a separate autosave feature for the Analyzer.

### 2.2 Creating a Dashboard

To create a dashboard, use the following overall process:

1. Log in to the User Portal in the desired namespace, as described earlier.

2. Click Menu > New Dashboard.

Or click the Add button

, which is above the list of dashboards, as follows:

Then click Add Dashboard.

Or click the < button at the left side of the User Portal, click Add, and then click Add Dashboard.

In any case, the system then displays a dialog box that prompts you for basic information about the new dashboard.

3. For Folder, optionally type a folder name or select an existing folder.

4. For Dashboard Name, type the name of the dashboard.

Note that this name is used (along with Folder) as the logical name of the dashboard; the system displays this logical
name when you use the Save As option, for example.

5. Optionally provide values for the other options as given in the next section.

6. Click OK.

The system creates, saves, and displays the dashboard, which is initially empty.

7. To configure the dashboard, use a combination of the follo wing tools:

- The Dashboard Editor. For an introduction, see Modifying Dashboard Settings.

- The Menu. For an introduction, see Adding a Widget to a Dashboard.

### 2.3 Modifying Dashboard Settings

To modify settings of a dashboard or of the widgets in a dashboard:

1. Display the dashboard as described in Accessing Business Intelligence Dashboards.

2. Click the > button to the left of the dashboard. (If this button is not visible, either the dashboard is not editable or you

do not have permission to edit it.) The following shows an example:

The system then expands the Dashboard Editor as follows:

To hide the Dashboard Editor, click the < button.

3. Click Dashboard Settings.

4. Specify any of the following options as needed:

- Locked — Select this option to temporarily prevent changes to this dashboard. If you select this option, you cannot edit the dashboard again unless you first clear the Locked option again.

- Public — Select this option to control whether this dashboard is displayed in the User Portal main area.

Important:

This option does not control access to the dashboard. Access is controlled instead by the Owner and Resource options, discussed later in this list.

Note that even if the dashboard is not marked as public, you can access it via Main > Open. Also, you can find it in the User Portal by using the Find option. See Using Dashboards and the User Portal.

- Page Settings > Company Name — Specify a name to display in the upper right corner. For example:

- Page Settings > Company Logo — Select an image to display in the upper right corner. For example:

If you specify this option, Page Settings > Company Name is ignored.

- Title — Specify the title of the dashboard.

If you specify a title, the main area of the User Portal displays the title of the dashboard. Otherwise, it displays the name of the dashboard.

Owner — Specify the InterSystems IRIS® data platform user who owns this dashboard. If a dashboard has an
owner, then only the owner can specify the Resource option for the dashboard; see the next item.

Resource — Specify the resource that is used to control access to this dashboard. See Visibility of Folders and
Folder Items.

Category — Specify the category to which this dashboard belongs. The User Portal uses this to group items in the Covers View. See Using Dashboards and the User Portal.

Description — Briefly describe the dashboard.

Keywords — List any keywords or phrases to help you find this dashboard later . Specify a comma-separated list of keywords or phrases.

These keywords are displayed in the User Portal.

Resize — Select this option to control whether users can move and resize the widgets on the dashboard.

Modify — Select this option to control whether users can modify the widgets on the dashboard.

Title Bars — Use this submenu to control the display of title bars on the widgets on this dashboard. You can also
customize their appearance. This submenu has the following options:

- –

- –

- –

- –

- –

- –

- –

- – Title Bars — Select ON or OFF.

Title Bar Color — Select a color to use for the title bar, to be used by default.

Title Bar Opacity — Specify the opacity of the title bar, to be used by default. The value 1 means 100%.

Text Color — Select a color for the text of the title bar, to be used by default.

Selected Color — Select a color to use for the title bar, to be used when the widget is selected.

Selected Opacity — Specify the opacity of the title bar, to be used when the widget is selected. The value 1 means 100%.

Selected Text Color — Select a color for the text of the title bar, to be used when the widget is selected.

Font — Select the typeface to use for the text in the title bar.

- Widget borders — Use this option to hide or display borders on all widgets.

- Work Lists — Specify the number of worklists in the dashboard. Note the following defaults:

–

–

In a two-worklist dashboard, by default, the top worklist is the Filters box, and the bottom worklist is the Favorites/Recent items box.

In a one-worklist dashboard, by default, the worklist is the Filters box.

- Background — Use this submenu to specify the background of the dashboard. This submenu has the following
options:

–

–

Background Color — Select the background color. Note that this color is used only if

Background Image — Select an optional background image. If you choose an image, the Background Color option is ignored.

–

Background Opacity — Specify the opacity of the background color or background image (whichever is used). The value 1 means 100%.

- Scalable Grid, Grid Rows, and Grid Columns — Use these options to specify the position and size of all widgets relative to a resizeable grid.

- If you enable the Scalable Grid option, when you move a widget, the upper left corner of widget aligns to the nearest grid point. Similarly, when you resize a widget, the lower right corner aligns to the nearest grid point. Use the Grid Rows and Grid Columns options to specify the grid. Note that the grid itself is not displayed.

If you resize the dashboard, all the widgets are automatically resized. Scalable Grid is the only option that supports this resizing behavior.

Snap Into Place — Use this option to control how widgets are placed on the dashboard. If you clear this option, you can position widgets freely anywhere on the dashboard, even overlapping each other. If you select this option, the system automatically aligns the widgets next to each other or below each other.

This option is available only if you clear the Scalable Grid option.

For details on the other parts of the Dashboard Editor, see the following articles:

- In some cases, the changes are saved automatically.

- In other cases, the system does not save the changes automatically. In these cases, it displays an indicator like the fol-
lowing as a reminder:

- In such cases, save the dashboard as described in Saving a Dashboard.

- 2.4 Adding a Widget to a Dashboard

- To add a widget to a dashboard, use the following general procedure:

- 1. Display the dashboard as described in Displaying Business Intelligence Dashboards.

2.

If you make unrelated changes to the dashboard, and if you want to keep those changes, save them.

When you add a widget, the Dashboard Designer saves the dashboard with the newly added widget but discards other unsaved changes.

3. Do one of the following:

Overview of Widget Types

- Click Menu > Add New Widget... — Use this option to add a new widget that does not include any configuration details.

- to the widget catalog.

You can reconfigure this widget, if needed; you can change an y detail except for the widget type. However, you
generally use this option when you have saved widgets that are already configured in common w ays for your needs.

- Display the Dashboard Editor, click Widgets, and then click the plus sign button.

The system then displays a wizard where you select a widget and specify basic information for it.

4. Navigate to a widget type and (if applicable) subtype.

5.

(For most types of widgets) Optionally specify of the following items:

- Data Source — Select the data source for this widget. See Names of Data Sources and Kinds of Data Sources.

- Link to — Select another widget on this dashboard to use as the source. See Linked Widgets.

Or specify a data source later, as described in Specifying the Data Source for a Widget.

6. Specify a name for Widget Name. Note that each dashboard widget must have a name.

7. Click OK to add the widget to your dashboard.

8. Optionally configure the widget. For information on specific types of widgets, see the follo wing articles:

- 9. Optionally add controls to the widget. See Adding Widget Controls.

- 2.5 Overview of Widget Types

- This section provides an overview of widget types.

- 2.5.1 Widget Types and Subtypes

- After you add widgets, you can reconfigure them in an y way other than modifying their type. Note that you can modify
the subtype, if applicable. The system provides the following widget types and subtypes:

- Pivot table widgets. This type of widget includes the table subtype and many chart subtypes.

Because there are so many chart options, charts are discussed separately from tables.

- Meter widgets. This type of widget includes many meter subtypes.

- Scorecard widgets. This type of widget includes two subtypes: regular and big.

- Calendar widgets. This type of widget includes one subtype.

- Map widgets. This type of widget includes one subtype.

- Portlet widgets. The subtypes include any portlets that you define.

- Controls widgets. This type of widget includes two subtypes: horizontal and vertical.

#### 2.5.2 Comparison of Widget Types

### 2.6 Reconfiguring a Widget

When you reconfigure this widget, you can change an y detail except for the widget type. To select and reconfigure a widget
on a given dashboard:

1. Display the dashboard as described in Displaying Business Intelligence Dashboards.

2. Display the Dashboard Editor.

3. Click Widgets.

The system then displays a list of the widgets in the dashboard.

Reconfiguring a Widget

4. Click the name of the widget in this list. This action selects the widget.

The system then displays a list of settings that you can modify. In most cases, the list includes submenus. The following
shows a partial example:

5. Optionally specify the following settings, which all widgets have:

- Name — Specify a name for internal use within this dashboard. One widget can refer to other widgets (for example, to filter another widget). F or these names, you might want to establish a set of naming conventions, for your convenience.

- Title — Specify any text to display in the title bar of the widget.

- Note that the dashboard can be configured to hide all title bars; see Modifying Dashboard Settings.

- Toolbar — Configure the toolbar for this widget. See the first subsection for details on this submenu.

Sidebar — Configure optional sidebar te xt for this widget. See the second subsection for details on this submenu.

The other submenus list additional items, depending on the kind of widget you select. For information, see the following
articles:

- 2.6.1 Toolbar Settings

- Use this submenu to configure the toolbar for the widget. Specify the follo wing options:

- Toolbar — This option enables or disables the toolbar. Select ON or OFF.

- When the toolbar is enabled, the system displays it if the widget is configured with an y buttons or any controls that require it (but see the Show Maximized option). If the widget has none of these, the system does not display the toolbar.

- When the toolbar is disabled, the system never displays the toolbar.

- InterSystems recommends that you specify Toolbar as ON.

- Bottom Border — This option displays or hides the bottom border of the toolbar. Select ON or OFF.

- Show Maximized — If this option is ON, the system displays the toolbar only when the widget is maximized.

- Toolbar Color — Select the color to use for the background of the toolbar. Or click X to restore the default color.

- Toolbar Opacity — Use this option to specify the opacity of the toolbar. The default is 1 (which is 100%).

- 2.6.2 Sidebar Settings Use this submenu to configure optional sidebar te xt for the widget, which is displayed in a rectangle on the right side of
the widget, as in the following example:

Specify the following options:

- Sidebar — This option enables or disables the sidebar. Select ON or OFF.

- Sidebar Content — Type the text to be displayed in the sidebar. You can include simple HTML markup such as the <p> and </p> tags, the <br> tag, the <i> and </i> tags, and the <b> and </b> tags.

- If you enclose text in the <p> and </p> tags, that text is automatically wrapped as shown in the preceding example.

Sidebar Width — Specify the width of the sidebar. Specify either a number (which is interpreted as the width in pixels) or a number followed by % (which is interpreted as a percentage of the width of the entire widget).

### 2.7 Specifying the Data Source for a Widget

To specify the data source for a widget:

1. Access the Dashboard Editor and select the widget as described in Reconfiguring a Widget.

2. Click Type & Data Source.

The system then displays the Type and Data submenu.

3. Specify one of the following options:

- Data Source — Select the data source for this widget. See Names of Data Sources and Kinds of Data Sources.

- Link to — Select another widget on this dashboard to use as the source. See Linked Widgets.

- Drilldown Target — This option enables the user to double-click a cell and access another dashboard. The newly opened dashboard is filtered by the conte xt in which the user double-clicked. For example, if the user doubleclicks in a cell that shows data for a specific city , the newly opened dashboard is filtered to that city .

To use this option, click the Search button

, click a dashboard, and click OK.

Note that the Widget Type option enables you to choose a different widget subtype; it does not let you choose a type.
See Widget Types and Subtypes, earlier in this page.

The following subsections provide details.

#### 2.7.1 Names of Data Sources

When you specify the data source for a widget, you refer to that data source by name. This logic simplifies the process of deploying dashboards and pivot tables to end users. But it also means that if you rename items, you must update any dashboards that use those elements.

When you open a dashboard, if the system cannot find a data source that it uses, the system displays as much of the dashboard
as possible. For example:

#### 2.7.2 Kinds of Data Sources

With exceptions noted below, a dashboard widget can display data from any of the following data sources:

Data source

Pivot tables

Detail listings

Where created

For information, see

Analyzer

Using the Analyzer

KPIs (key performance indicators)

production business metrics (available only in an interoperability-enabled namespace)

IDE

IDE

Implementing InterSystems Business
Intelligence

Developing Productions

Exceptions:

- A detail listing can be displayed only in a pivot table widget (in table mode).

The kind of data source does not affect the appearance of the widget; for example, the user cannot tell if a given chart is
displaying data from a pivot table, a KPI, or a business metric.

Note that some kinds of widgets do not use data sources.

#### 2.7.3 Linked Widgets

When you specify the Link to option for a widget, you configure that widget as a dependent widget that is linked to another
widget (an independent widget). The following rules govern linked widgets:

- One independent widget can be linked to any number of dependent widgets in the same dashboard.

- You cannot chain widgets; that is, Link to must be an independent widget rather than another dependent widget.

- When you drill down on a row in the independent widget, the system also drills down in the dependent widgets.

- If you filter the independent widget, the system also filters the dependent widgets. Any filters on the dependent widgets are ignored.

- If you use the Mini Analyzer to redefine the independent widget, the system also redefines the dependent widgets.

### 2.8 Saving a Widget to the Widget Catalog

You can copy a widget (including all its configuration details) to the widget catalog. To do so:

1. Display the dashboard that contains the widget. See Displaying Business Intelligence Dashboards.

2. Display the Dashboard Editor.

3. Access the Dashboard Editor and select the widget as described in Reconfiguring a Widget.

4. Click Menu > Save Widget to Catalog ... .

The system displays a dialog box in which you specify details for the widget in the catalog.

5. Specify Folder, Widget Name, and other options. For information, see Adding a Widget to a Dashboard.

6. Click OK.

If you have already saved a widget with this name, in the given folder, the system prompts you to confirm that you want to overwrite the previously saved widget.

7. Click OK.

No change is made to the dashboard itself.

The saved copy does not include any local overrides. That is, if you have customized the pivot table by using the Mini Analyzer, those customizations are not included in the widget catalog.

### 2.9 Removing a Widget from a Dashboard

To remove a widget from a dashboard:

1. Display the Dashboard Editor.

2.

If you make unrelated changes to the dashboard, and if you want to keep those changes, save them.

When you remove a widget, the Dashboard Designer automatically saves the dashboard, now without the removed widget. In this step, the Dashboard Designer discards other changes that you made and did not save.

3. Click Widgets.

4. Click the X button next to the widget name. The change is saved automatically.

### 2.10 Clearing the Autosave State of a Dashboard

If the autosave feature for the User Portal is enabled, then when you display a dashboard, the User Portal displays that dashboard with any unsaved changes that you might have made. To remove these unsaved changes, click Menu > Clear Autosave State. Then the User Portal displays the dashboard as defined in its sa ved definition.

Or save the dashboard, thus saving the changes and changing the definition. See the next topic.

Saving a Dashboard

### 2.11 Saving a Dashboard

To save the dashboard you are working on, do one of the following:

- Click Save.

The system saves the dashboard immediately.

- Click Menu > Save.

- The system saves the dashboard immediately.

Specify some or all of the following options and then click OK:

–

Folder — Specify the folder, if any, to which the dashboard belongs. Either type a folder name or select an existing folder. If desired, use the slash character (/) to specify a subfolder. For example, you can enter the following for
Folder:

My Folder/My Subfolder

Do not start the first folder name with a dollar sign ( $); if you do, the dashboard definition is accessible only in
your IDE.

–

Dashboard Name — Specify the name of the dashboard.

For information on the other options, see Modifying Dashboard Settings, earlier in this page.

### 2.12 Copying a Dashboard

To copy a dashboard, do the following:

1. Display the dashboard as described in Displaying Business Intelligence Dashboards.

3. Specify the options as described in the previous section (and in Modifying Dashboard Settings)

4. Click OK.

### 2.13 Deleting a Dashboard

One way to delete a dashboard is as follows:

1. Display the dashboard as described in Displaying Business Intelligence Dashboards.

2. Click Menu > Delete Dashboard.

The system prompts you to confirm.

3. Click OK.

Note: When you delete a dashboard, the system moves it into a folder named $TRASH, which the User Portal does not

display.

#### 2.13.1 Deleting a Dashboard in the User Portal

You can also delete a dashboard in the User Portal.

- If the User Portal is in Covers View, click the dashboard cover and then click the X in the dialog box. Then click OK to confirm.

- If the User Portal is in List View, click the X button in the row that lists the dashboard. Then click OK to confirm.

The User Portal does not display private dashboards. To delete a private dashboard, you must change it to be public and
then delete it; see Modifying Dashboard Settings. Or delete the dashboard in the Folder Manager, which displays all items
(both public and private); see Introduction to the Business Intelligence User Interfaces.

This page describes options that are used in multiple places when you configure widgets on Business Intelligence dashboards.

### 3.1 Customizing Print Settings for a Widget

You can print most kinds of widgets. To customize how the system prints a widget, access the Dashboard Editor, select the widget as described in Reconfiguring a Widget, and click Print Setup and then click Page Setup. You can modify the
following options:

- Reset — Click this to restore the default print settings for this widget.

- Page Size — Specify the size of the pages. Choose a page size.

- Units — (Read only) This field displays the units associated with the page size you selected.

- Orientation — Specify the orientation of the pages.

- Title — Specify an optional title to include in the PDF. See the first subsection for special options.

- Subtitle — Specify an optional subtitle to include in the PDF. See the first subsection for special options.

- Show Subtitle — Click On to include the subtitle in the PDF. Or click Off not to include the subtitle.

- Listing Settings — Select this to access additional options that apply when the output is a detail listing. Then specify options as described in the subsection Listing Settings.

- Filter Settings — Select this to access options that control the appearance of information about any filters applied to this pivot table. Then specify options as described in the first subsection .

- Show Date — Click On to include the current date in the PDF, at the top of the first page. Or click Off to omit this information.

- Show User — Click On to include the current user in the PDF, at the top of the first page. Or click Off to omit this information.

- Page Margins options: Top, Bottom, Left, and Right — Specify the size of the top, bottom, left, and right margins, respectively.

Note that the Title, Subtitle, and Show Date options apply to Excel Export as well.

#### 3.1.1 Requirements for Printing

When a user invokes the Print option, InterSystems IRIS uses Java to call out to a third-party PDF rendering tool. This means that Java (or specifically JRE, Ja va Runtime Environment) is required on the server accessed by the user’s local machine. For information on the requirements, see Configuring InterSystems IRIS for PDF Output

.

#### 3.1.2 Special Options for the Title and Subtitle

Within the Title and Subtitle fields, you can include a combination of static te xt and the following tokens:

- {@filter.filterName} where filterName is the name of a filter defined for the gi
as provided in the Filter dropdown menu in the Dashboard Designer.

- ven widget. Use the same name

- In the PDF, this token is replaced with the current value of that filter .

{@date.dateFormat} where dateFormat is an integer date format, with the same meaning as the dformat argument
of $ZDATETIME.

In the PDF, this token is replaced with the date in the given format, followed by the time in 24–hour format.

{@variable.variableName} where variableName is the name of a runtime variable.

In the PDF, this token is replaced with the current value of that variable.

#### 3.1.3 Listing Settings

For Listing Settings, specify some or all of the following options, which take effect when the output is a detail listing:

- Show Listing Filters — Click On to include information on the context used for the detail listing (that is, which member or members were selected before the listing was requested, as well as any filters that were in use). Or click Off to omit this information.

- Show Zebra Stripes — Click On to use different colors for alternating rows. Or click Off to use the same color for all rows.

- Font Size — Specify the font size, including units, for example: 6pt

#### 3.1.4 Filter Settings

For Filter Settings, specify some or all of the following options, which control the presentation of the filter information:

- Show Filters — Specify the presentation of the filter information. Select By Table (to display this information as a table on the top of the first page), By Title (to display this information as the subtitle or appended to the subtitle), or Off (to not display this information).

- By default, the filter information is appended to the subtitle area to the right of an y specified subtitle.

- When you display filter information as a table, the table has tw o columns with level names (that is, the filter names) on the left and member names (that is, filter item names) on the right.

Table Style — Specify options to control the appearance of the table that is used to display the filter information.

These options affect both the caption column (the left column) and the item column (the right column).

Row Header Style — Specify options to control the appearance of the row headers. These options override the Table Style options.

Adding Widget Properties

- Item Style — Specify options to control the appearance of the item column. These options override the Table Style options.

- Display Format for NOW — Specify how to display the NOW member of any time level, if that member is used in the
filter and if the filter information is sho wn. Specify any of the dformat options of the $ZDATE function. For example,
specify 3 for ODBC format (for example, 2015-03-27).

If you leave this option blank, the PDF shows the NOW member as NOW.

### 3.2 Adding Widget Properties

Some kinds of widgets require properties, each of which typically corresponds to a value in the configured data source. (For example, if the data source is a pivot table, each property of the widget can be a measure in that pivot table.)

For a meter widget, each property is displayed in a separate meter within the widget. Similarly, for pivot table widgets, each property is displayed as a separate column. Scorecards have columns, which are similar to properties and can be configured in a similar w ay.

To add a property to a widget:

1. Access the Dashboard Editor and select the widget as described in Reconfiguring a Widget.

2. Click Data Properties.

The system displays the Data Properties submenu, which lists any properties defined for this widget. F or example:

3. Click the plus sign + button.

The system displays a dialog box where you specify the property.

4. For Value, select the property of the data source to display.

For a meter widget or a scorecard, you can instead type a numeric constant.

If you manually edit Value, note that if Value has a numeric value, the system assumes it is a numeric constant and displays that. If Value has the form =[propertyname], the system assumes it is a property of the data source and thus displays the value of that property. When you select a property, the system automatically wraps the property with =[].

For a scorecard, you can instead type a formula.

5. Optionally specify the following additional items:

- Label — Type a label or optionally click the check box to the right of Label. If you click the check box, the system
uses the localized name of this property as the label; this option applies only when Value is a data source property.

- If you type a label, note that you can include \n to force a line break in the label.

Hidden — Select this option to hide this value.

- Value Column — Select this option to configure the v alue in this column as the value of the row. This value is
passed to any custom actions; see Specifying the Value of a Row.

- Select this option for only one data property of the widget.

Format — Type a format string.

Or specify these options later if you modify the property as described in the next section.

6. Click OK.

### 3.3 Managing Widget Properties

For any widget that defines properties, the Data Properties submenu lists the properties defined for this widget. F or example:

In addition to the specific property options documented else where, you can perform the following general activities:

- Change the order of the properties. To do so, first click the icon to the left of the property name, so that this icon is

highlighted:

Then drag the property up or down in the list.

- Delete a property. To do so, click the X button in the row for that property.

- Reconfigure a property . To do so, click the property name. The system then displays a submenu with options. For details on the options, see the previous section. You can also specify Name. Make changes as needed.

### 3.4 Specifying Numeric Format Strings

In some meters and other places that display numeric values, you can use the Format option to control the display of numbers. In some cases, you can select an option or type a numeric format string. In other cases, you must type a numeric format string.

#### 3.4.1 Selecting a Format String

In some cases, the Dashboard Editor provides the following set of choices for Format:

Option

###

###.#

###.##

Example

6609.1

6609.12

###.###

6609.123

#,##

#,##.#

6,609

6,609.1

#,##.##

6,609.12

#,##.###

6,609.123

##.##%

660912.3%

#### 3.4.2 Typing a Numeric Format String

In all applicable places, you can instead type a numeric format string, which provides more options. You can specify a
string that consists of one to four pieces as follows:

positive_piece;negative_piece;zero_piece;missing_piece

Where positive_piece controls how a positive value is displayed, negative_piece controls how a negative value is displayed, zero_piece controls how zero is displayed, and missing_piece controls how a missing value is displayed.

Each piece is a string that includes one of the following base units:

#

#,#

#.##

#,#.##

Display the value without the thousands separator and without decimal places.

12345

Display the value with the thousands separator. Do not include any decimal places. This is the default display format for positive numbers.

Display the value without the thousands separator. Include two decimal places (or one decimal place for each pound sign after the period). Specify as many pound signs after the period as you need.

12,345

12345.67

Display the value with the thousands separator. Include two decimal places (or one decimal place for each pound sign after the period). Specify as many pound signs after the period as you need.

12,345.67

You can include additional characters before or after the base unit.

- If you include a percent sign (%), the system displays the value as a percentage. That is, it multiplies the value by 100 and it displays the percent sign (%) in the position you specify.

- Any other characters are displayed as given, in the position you specify.

The following table shows some examples:

#### 3.4.3 Localization of Numeric Separators

Conventions regarding the use of specific numeric separators v ary by locale. For example, within the United States, the comma , is used as the thousands separator, while the period . is used as the decimal separator. In many European countries, the period . is used as the thousands separator, while the comma , is used as the decimal separator.

This localization is applied automatically by InterSystems IRIS in accordance with your chosen instance locale; consequently,
the formatting syntax for numeric strings is locale agnostic. Consider the following example.

In the bar chart widget depicted below, the Value Format in the bottom left corner is set to #,#.###, which causes the chart to use thousands separators and show three decimal places.

This same widget, with an identical Value Format string, will display the chart with European-style separators when the
instance locale is set to one of the relevant European locales, as seen in the following image:

In order to leverage this automatic localization, ensure that you follow the instructions for selecting a locale described in
Locale Definitions.

Specifying Table Text Styles

### 3.5 Specifying Table Text Styles

In tables and chart legends, you can specify options that control the display of text. The options are as follows:

- Color — Specify the color of the text. The following shows an example of the user interface:

To specify a color, optionally choose the name of a color palette from the drop-down list. (For example, the list option Standard corresponds to the color palette shown in the preceding example.) Then click a color in the grid to choose that color.

Or click the magnifying glass icon, which displays a full-range color chooser. Click a color here or use the sliders to specify the red, green, and blue components of your color selection.

To clear the color selection, click the X.

Tip: An authorized user can add custom color palettes. See Creating Custom Color Palettes.

- Background — Specify the color of the background, in the same way as described in the previous item.

- Opacity — Use this option to specify the opacity of the background. The value 1 means 100%.

- Font — Specify the typeface of the text. Select a typeface. To clear the typeface selection, click Default, at the top of the list.

- Font Size — Use the slider to specify the size of the text or type a value into the input box.

To clear the size selection, click the check box.

- Text Style — Specify the style of the text.

Select one or more options. The first three options mak e the text bold, italic, and underlined, respectively. The Cc
option changes the text to capital letters as in the following example:

The S option adds shadows to the text as follows:

- Align — Specify the alignment of the text.

These options make the text left-aligned, centered, and right-aligned, respectively.

### 3.6 Specifying Chart Text Styles

In charts and other graphical elements, you can specify options that control the display of text. The options are as follows:

- Color — Specify the color of the text. For information on specifying this option and other color options, see the Color option in the previous section.

- Stroke — Specify the color of the outline of the characters in the text. The following figure sho ws an example where
Color is blue and Stroke is black:

- By default, the system uses the same color for the outline as for the text itself.

- Stroke Width — Use this option to specify the width of the outline. The following shows an example of a medium-
width outline:

- To clear the setting, click the check box.

Opacity — Use this option to specify the opacity of the text (which is 100% by default).

Font, Text Size, Text Style — See Font, Font Size, Text Style in the previous section.

### 3.7 Specifying Line Styles

In numerous places, you can specify options that control the display of lines and other graphical elements. The options are
as follows:

- Fill — Specify the color to use within the graphical element. This option applies to line markers and to parts of speedometers, for example. For information on specifying this option and other color options, see the Color option in Specifying Table Text Styles, earlier in this page.

- Opacity — Use this option to specify the opacity of graphical element (which is 100% by default).

- Line — Specify the color of the line that outlines the graphical element.

- Line Width — Use this option to specify the width of the line.

- Line Style — Specify the style of the line. Click Solid, Dashed, or Dotted.

Specifying Line Styles

This page describes how to add pivot table widgets to a Business Intelligence dashboard. These widgets can display any kind of data source, not just pivot tables.

For information on creating pivot tables, see Using the Analyzer.

Note that chart widgets are a kind of pivot table widget. For specific information on charts, see Adding Chart Widgets.

### 4.1 Adding a Pivot Table Widget

To add a pivot table widget:

2. Click Pivots and Charts.

3. Click Table.

4. For Data source, do one of the following:

- Click the Search button

- and then select a data source Use the Link to drop-down list to select another widget on the same dashboard.

You can use any type of data source, not just pivot tables.

Note:

If you do use a pivot table as the data source, note that pivot tables are created in the Analyzer, discussed in Using the Analyzer. The Analyzer provides options for changing the state of the pivot table: filtering, drilling down, displaying listings, and displaying in chart format. When you save a pivot table, the system saves the state as part of the pivot table definition. The next time the pivot table is accessed (either in the Analyzer or in a widget on a dashboard), the system displays the pivot table in the state in which it was saved.

5. Optionally specify the basic settings, as described in Adding a Widget to a Dashboard.

6. Click OK.

7. Optionally configure the widget further as described in the rest of this page.

8. Optionally add controls, as described in Adding Widget Controls.

### 4.2 Specifying Widget Settings for a Pivot Table Widget

To customize the available options in a widget, access the Dashboard Editor, select the widget as described in Reconfiguring a Widget, and then click Widget Settings. This menu primarily provides options for the user.

For a pivot table widget (including any chart widget), the Widget Settings menu has the following options:

- This option is supported only when the data source is a pivot table.

- on the toolbar. This button enables the users Excel Export — Select this option to include the Export button export the data in this widget to Microsoft Excel.

on the toolbar. This button enables the users to

Row selection — Use this option to display check boxes on the widget; the user can use these check boxes to select
rows to which to apply actions. Select single to enable the user to select only a single row, or multi to enable the user to select multiple rows.

By default, these check boxes are not displayed, and the user cannot select rows in the widget. (The user can always select cells and ranges of cells in the widget.)

This option is supported only when the data source is a KPI.

Show Dimensions — Select this option to include the Dimension List button
an extra drilling option. Users can drag and drop items from this list on the gray part of the rows in the pivot table;
when they do, the system drills down as requested.

on the toolbar. This button provides

This option is supported only when the data source is a pivot table and the widget is in table format.

Note: When you enable or disable this option, the Dashboard Designer automatically saves the dashboard.

Dimension Source — For advanced use, this option enables you to specify an alternative set of drill options to show in the dimension list.

Initial Execute — By default, this option is selected, which means that the system executes the query underlying this widget as soon as the user displays the dashboard. Clear this option if you want execute the query later. If you clear Initial Execute, make sure to include a refresh control on this widget. See Adding Widget Controls.

Customizing the Columns (When Displaying a KPI)

- Pivot Preview — If enabled, this option uses the HEAD function to truncate the results of any query the widget makes
involving a CROSSJOIN. Selecting the Show All button displays the full result set. By default, this option is disabled;
users experiencing long load times can enable it.

Note: Most of these options add a button to the toolbar. If you enable any of those options, be sure the toolbar is visible

(its display is controlled via the Toolbar option in Settings). See Reconfiguring a Widget.

### 4.3 Customizing the Columns (When Displaying a KPI)

By default, when a pivot table widget displays a KPI, it displays all the columns defined in that data source. You can customize the columns. For information, see Adding Widget Properties.

### 4.4 Displaying a Listing in a Pivot Table Widget

To display a listing directly in a pivot table widget:

1. Do the following in the Analyzer:

a. Create a pivot table with one cell. Filter this pivot table as needed for the listing.

See Using the Analyzer.

b.

Select the cell and click the listing button

to display the listing.

c. Save the pivot table.

2.

In the desired dashboard, add a pivot table widget that use this pivot table as its data source.

3. Optionally add filter controls; these restrict the set of records that are shown.

### 4.5 Customizing the Appearance of a Pivot Table

The system provides a rich set of options that you can use to customize the appearance of a pivot table widget. To access these options, access the Dashboard Editor, select the widget as described in Reconfiguring a Widget and click Table Settings.
This menu has two submenus:

- Size & Appearance — Provides options to control the size of the data cells and the form of the pivot table. See the first subsection for details.

- Colors & Style — Provides options to control colors, typeface, text style, and text alignment in the pivot table. See the second subsection for details.

Note:

The easiest way to systematically alter the appearance of dashboards is to define and use themes, which are discussed in Defining and Using Themes. Themes use the options described in the following subsections.

#### 4.5.1 Size and Appearance Options

To control the size of the data cells and the form of the pivot table, access the Dashboard Editor, select the widget as described in Reconfiguring a Widget, click Table Settings, and click Size & Appearance. This menu has the following
options:

- Cell Width — Specify the width, in pixels, of the data cells. For example:

This example also uses Cell Height.

- Cell Height — Specify the height, in pixels, of the data cells. See the previous example.

- Show Empty — Use these options to control whether empty rows and columns are displayed. For example, if you
enable the Show Empty option for rows, the system displays empty rows as follows:

- Span Labels — Use these options to control whether row and column labels are spanned.

When you display the table in a nested format, the labels are spanned by default. For example:

Customizing the Appearance of a Pivot Table

If you enable the Span Labels option for rows, the system repeats the relevant labels, as follows:

- Row Totals — Use this option to control whether the pivot table includes a summary row at the bottom. For example:

This example also uses Column Totals.

- Row Summary — Specify the form of the summary row. For example, choose Sum or Average.

- Sum Over, choose either Page or All Rows. This option determines whether the summary row uses only the current page of the pivot table or all rows.

- Column Totals — Use this option to control whether the pivot table includes a summary column at the right. See the example for Row Totals.

- Row Caption — Use this option to display or hide the caption that appears above the row headers. In the following
example. the row captions are hidden:

#### 4.5.2 Color and Style Options

To control the colors, typeface, and other such aspects of the pivot table, access the Dashboard Editor, select the widget as
described in Reconfiguring a Widget, click Table Settings, and click Colors & Style. This menu has the following options:

- Cell Style — Use this submenu to modify the colors, typeface, text style, and text alignment used in all data cells of
the pivot table. For example:

For details on this and other submenus, see Specifying Table Text Styles.

- Row Style — Use this submenu to modify the colors, typeface, text style, and text alignment used in the row headers
of the pivot table. For example:

- Column Style — Use this submenu to modify the colors, typeface, text style, and text alignment used in the column
headers of the pivot table. For example:

- Stripes — Select this option to format the pivot table with zebra stripes. If you enable Stripes, the table is formatted
with rows in alternating colors as follows:

- Stripe Style — Use this submenu to modify the colors, typeface, text style, and text alignment used in the even rows,
when zebra stripes are enabled. For example:

Removing a Pivot Table Redefinition

- Background — Select the background color of the pivot table. For example:

- Opacity — Specify the opacity of the background. The value 1 means 100%.

### 4.6 Removing a Pivot Table Redefinition

Via the Mini Analyzer, a user can redefine a pi vot table as used in a given dashboard widget. See Using the Analyzer.

To remove any redefinition performed this w ay:

1. Access the Dashboard Editor and select the widget as described in Reconfiguring a Widget.

2. Click Type and Data Source.

3. Click Reset Data Source.

If the Reset Data Source option is grayed out, this widget uses the pivot table as it was originally defined in the Analyzer.

4. Click OK.

Or click the Mini Analyzer button

, click Reset, and then click OK.

This page describes how to add charts to a Business Intelligence dashboard.

Also see Specifying Widget Settings for a Pivot Table Widget, as well as Customizing the Appearance of a Chart Widget.

### 5.1 Adding a Chart Widget

To add a chart widget:

2. Click Pivots and Charts.

3. Click a chart type.

4. For Data source, do one of the following:

- Click the Search button

- and then select a data source.

Use the Link to drop-down list to select another widget on the same dashboard.

Note:

If you use a pivot table as the data source, note that pivot tables are created in the Analyzer, discussed in Using the Analyzer. The Analyzer provides options for changing the state of the pivot table: filtering, drilling down, displaying listings, and displaying in chart format. When you save a pivot table, the system saves the state as part of the pivot table definition. The next time the pivot table is accessed (either in the Analyzer or in a widget on a dashboard), the system displays the pivot table in that state.

5. Optionally specify the basic settings, as described in Adding a Widget to a Dashboard.

6. Click OK.

7. Optionally customize the chart type, as described in the next section.

8. Optionally configure the widget further as described in the rest of this page.

9. Optionally add controls, as described in Adding Widget Controls.

### 5.2 Customizing the Chart Type

You can reconfigure a chart widget to use a dif ferent chart type. To do so:

1. Access the Dashboard Editor and select the widget as described in Reconfiguring a Widget.

2. Click Chart Settings.

3. Click Chart Type.

4. Click a type.

You can also use these steps to reconfigure a pivot widget to display a chart.

### 5.3 Chart Requirements

A chart is usually more useful if the data source uses members as rows and uses measures as columns.

Notes:

- If you use a pivot table that has a summary row or summary column, that row or column is ignored.

- Many of the chart types are also available in the Analyzer, where you can preview them before adding them to a dashboard.

- Except in the case of line charts and time charts, only the first 400 chart items are displayed.

### 5.4 Available Chart Types

The following subsections show examples of the available chart types:

Bar and column charts

Line and area charts

Combo charts

High low charts

Pie charts

X/Y charts

Bubble charts

Time charts

Tree map charts

Bullseye charts

Swirl charts

- 5.4.1 Bar and Column Charts

- The system provides several styles of bar and column charts, both horizontal and vertical. One group of bars is created for each row of the data source. In a group of bars, each bar displays a different measure. The following example shows a chart
with one measure:

- This chart is based on the following pivot table:

- 5.4.2 Line and Area Charts

- The system provides two line charts and an area chart. For each of these, the horizontal axis has one label for each row of the data source. One line is created for each column of the data source. (For the area chart, the area below the line is filled in.)

- The following shows an example:

- This chart is based on the following pivot table:

- 5.4.3 Combo Charts

- Note:

- Combo charts are available only in dashboards, not in the Analyzer.

- The InterSystems IRIS Business Intelligence combo chart is similar to the preceding charts, but provides two unique features:

- It can have multiple y-axes.

- It can use different display types for different columns of the data source. The system automatically displays lines in the foreground, bars behind the lines, and areas behind the bars.

The following chart demonstrates both features:

Notice that the y-axis is labeled Patient Count. The filled area that displays the Patient Count measure is scaled to match the values on this axis. In contrast, the line that displays Avg Enc Count does not correlate with the y-axis — this line is only scaled overall to fit within the chart.

To use a combo chart, the user clicks the box next to the name of a series, in the key. If we click the box next to Avg Age,
the labels on the y-axis change as follows:

This chart is configured so that for the first series,

y-Axis is 1, and for the second series, y-Axis is 2.

In contrast, if y-Axis is the same for both series, we would see the following (in which all the items are drawn to the same
scale):

#### 5.4.4 High Low Charts

A high low chart is similar to a bar chart but instead uses each bar to display a low value and a high value. It requires at least two columns in the data source. It displays one bar for each row of the data source. The upper and lower values are
determined by the first tw o columns in the data source. For example:

This chart is based on the following pivot table:

If there is a third column, the chart displays a triangle for that value. For example:

In this case, the third column displays the average values.

Other columns are ignored.

#### 5.4.5 Pie Charts

A pie chart displays one wedge for each cell of the data source. The area of each wedge is proportional to the value in the
cell. If the data source displays only one column, a pie chart might look like this:

This chart is based on the following pivot table:

If you enable the Show Multiples option, the widget displays one chart for each column of the data source. The chart displays
one wedge for each cell in that column. For example:

#### 5.4.6 X/Y Charts

An X/Y chart plots one value on the x-axis and another value on the y-axis. The data source must have at least two columns. The chart displays a data point for each row of the data source, and it connects these data points with lines.

The first column determines the horizontal position of the data point, and the second column determines the v ertical position.
The following shows an example:

This chart is based on the following pivot table:

If the underlying pivot table contains additional columns, they are used to create additional sets of connected data points on the chart. That is, for each additional column, the chart contains a set of data points at the same horizontal positions.
For example:

This chart is based on the following pivot table:

#### 5.4.7 Bubble Charts

Note:

Bubble charts are available only in dashboards, not in the Analyzer.

A bubble chart is similar to the X/Y chart. It plots one value on the x-axis and another value on the y-axis. The data source must have at least two columns. The chart displays an elliptical bubble for each row of the data source. The measures are
used as follows:

- The first column determines the horizontal position of the b ubble.

- The second column determines the vertical position.

- The third column, if included, determines the radius of the bubble.

- The fourth column, if included, controls additional colorization that is added to the bubbles. All data rows that have the same value for the fourth measure are shown in the same color.

- The fifth column, if included, determines the opacity of the b ubble.

Other columns are ignored.

The following example shows a bubble chart that uses two columns:

This chart is based on the following pivot table:

#### 5.4.8 Time Charts

Note:

Time charts are available only in dashboards, not in the Analyzer.

A time chart is useful for displaying values over time. For this kind of chart, the data source must have time members (such
as years) for rows. The following shows an example:

This chart is based on the following pivot table:

Time charts are supported only for levels that are based on the following time functions: DayMonthYear, MonthYear, WeekYear, and Year. Also, time charts are not recommended for spans of time greater than approximately ten years.

#### 5.4.9 Tree Maps

Note:

Tree maps are available only in dashboards, not in the Analyzer.

A tree map has one rectangle divided into smaller rectangles, each of which corresponds to one cell in the data source. The area of each rectangle is proportional to the value in the cell. If the data source displays only one measure, a tree map might
look like this:

This tree map uses the following pivot table:

If the data source has multiple columns, be sure to enable the Show Multiples option. In this case, the widget displays a subdivided rectangle for each column.

#### 5.4.10 Bullseye Charts

Note:

Bullseye charts are available only in dashboards, not in the Analyzer.

A bullseye chart can be useful to demonstrate the size of a set relative to a larger set. The following shows an example:

This chart is based on the following pivot table:

If the data source has multiple columns, be sure to enable the Show Multiples option. In this case, the widget displays a subdivided circle for each column in the data source.

#### 5.4.11 Swirl Charts

Note:

Swirl charts are available only in dashboards, not in the Analyzer.

A swirl chart is similar to a pie chart. It displays one wedge (or group of wedges) for each row of the underlying pivot table.
The following shows an example:

This chart is based on the following pivot table:

If the underlying pivot table has multiple columns, the swirl chart includes multiple wedges for any given row. For example:

This chart is based on the following pivot table:

### 5.5 Displaying a Production Business Metric

This section discusses suitable ways to display production business metrics in charts. There are four general possibilities:

The metric defines only one instance (the def ault) and does not define AUTOHISTORY for any of the properties. In
this case, when you display the metric as a pivot table, it appears with one row as follows:

Displaying a Production Business Metric

In this case, any kind of chart is suitable.

The metric defines multiple instances and does not define AUTOHISTORY for any of the properties. In this case, when
you display the metric as a pivot table, it appears as follows:

- In this case, the most suitable chart types are bar and column charts and combo charts.

- The metric defines only one instance (the def ault) and defines AUTOHISTORY for some or all of the properties. In
this case, when you display the metric as a pivot table, it appears as follows:

- In this case, the most suitable chart types are bar and column charts, line charts, and combo charts.

Or, if a given property does not specify AUTOHISTORY, the column for that property is empty except for the last row. You might prefer to display only the properties that specify AUTOHISTORY. To do so, you can add a filter control and filter the data to sho w only those properties. Note that you can hide this control from the user.

- The metric defines multiple instances and defines AUTOHISTORY for some or all of the properties. In this case, when
you display the metric as a pivot table, the AUTOHISTORY is ignored by default, and the metric appears as follows:

In this case, the most suitable chart types are bar and column charts and combo charts.

and filter the data to sho w only one To force the metric to display the AUTOHISTORY, you can add a filter control instance. Note that you can hide this control from the user. When filtered to display one instance, the metric appears
as follows:

In this case, the most suitable chart types are bar and column charts, line charts, and combo charts.

Customizing the Appearance of a Chart
Widget

The system provides a rich set of options that you can use to customize the appearance of a chart widget on a Business Intelligence dashboard. To access these options, access the Dashboard Editor, select the widget as described in Reconfig-
uring a Widget, and use the options in the Chart and Pivot section. The following submenus affect the appearance of a chart:

- Chart Settings > Chart Type — Enables you to select a chart type.

- Chart Settings > Size & Appearance — Provides options to control the chart overall.

- Chart Settings > Titles & Labels — Provides options to control the text and formatting of titles and labels on the chart.

- Chart Settings > No Data Warnings — Provides options to control an optional warning if there is no data to display.

- Chart Settings > Colors & Style — Provides options to control colors and line styles in the chart.

- Chart Settings > x Axis — Provides options to customize the text and formatting of the x-axis of the chart.

- Chart Settings > y Axis — Provides options to customize the text and formatting of the y-axis or y-axes of the chart.

- Chart Settings > Series Details — Provides options to customize how each series (row of the data source) is displayed.

- Chart Legend — Provides options to disable, enable, and customize the chart legend.

The following subsections provide details.

Note:

The easiest way to systematically alter the appearance of dashboards is to define and use themes, which are discussed in Defining and Using Themes. Themes use the options described in many of the following subsections.

### 6.1 Size and Appearance Options

To customize the overall size and appearance of a chart, access the Dashboard Editor, select the widget as described in Reconfiguring a Widget, click Chart Settings > Size & Appearance, and use the options listed there. The following options
are available:

- Margins — Use this submenu to customize the margins of the chart. Use the Top, Left, Right, and Bottom sliders to separately control the top, left, right, and bottom margins. For each margin, use the Units setting to specify the margin either as a percentage of the widget size or in pixels.

Or specify Units as Auto to use the default margins.

Customizing the Appearance of a Chart Widget

- Multiples — Select this option to display one chart for each series (row of the data source). For example:

This option is recommended for pie charts and tree maps.

Pivot (applies only to charts that have x- and y-axes) — Select this option to switch the x- and y-axes.

Stacked (applies only to charts that have x- and y-axes) — Select this option to display the series (rows of the data
source) in stacked form. For example:

This option affects only the series that are displayed as bars.

Filled (applies only to line and area charts) — Select this option to control whether the system fills in the area belo w the series lines on the chart.

Appearance — Use this option to control whether the chart is displayed with a three-dimensional appearance. For
example:

- Zoom — Enable this option to display zoom buttons on the lower left of the chart. For example:

- This option applies only to charts that have x- and y-axes.

- Pie Height (applies only to pie charts) — Use this option to control the height of the pie chart, if Appearance is 3D. For
example:

- Pie Size (applies only to pie charts) — Use this option to control the radius of the pie chart.

- Pie Hole Size (applies only to pie charts) — Use this option to control the size of the pie hole. For example:

- Customizing the Appearance of a Chart Widget

- The default hole size is zero.

- Quadrant (applies only to bubble charts) — Select this option to divide the chart into quadrants, marked by different
colors. For example:

- Radius (applies only to bubble charts) — Use this option to control the basic size of the bubbles in a bubble chart.

- Opacity (applies only to bubble charts) — Use this option to control the opacity of the bubbles in a bubble chart.

- Regression (applies only to bubble charts) — Select this option to display a regression line on the chart. For example:

- Separate Series Scale (applies only to swirl charts) — Controls the scaling of the wedges, in the case when the underlying pivot table has multiple columns. By default, the chart uses a single scale to determine the size of each wedge, and the wedge for the maximum of one column is likely to be different from the wedge for the maximum of another column. (For examples, see Plot By.)

- If Separate Series Scale is On, the chart uses a separate scale for each column, and the maximum wedge for any column
is the same size, as in the following example (which uses both Patient Count and Allergy Count as columns) :

- Invert (applies only to swirl charts) — Click On to display the labels in the outer area of the chart, rather than within
the center. For example:

Customizing the Appearance of a Chart Widget

- Gap (applies only to swirl charts) — Use this to control the size of the gaps between the wedges. The following shows
an example with a minimal gap:

- Plot By (applies only to swirl charts) — Controls how the wedges are colored; this is particularly useful if the underlying
pivot table displays multiple columns. If you click items, the chart uses similar colors for the all wedges that belong to the same row in the pivot table on which this chart is based. For example, the following swirl chart is based on a pivot table that uses Patient Count and Allergy Count for columns. Notice that, for example, Sunday has two wedges
of similar color; one is for Patient Count and the other is for Allergy Count.

If you click series, the chart uses a single color for the all wedges that belong to the same column, so that the chart has a separate color for each column. For example, the following swirl chart is the same as the preceding except that Plot
By is set to series:

### 6.2 Title and Label Options

To customize the titles and labels of a chart, access the Dashboard Editor, select the widget as described in Reconfiguring
a Widget, click Chart Settings > Titles & Labels, and use the options listed there. The following options are available:

- Title — Use this option to specify an optional title within the chart. For example:

Customizing the Appearance of a Chart Widget

- Title Style — Use this submenu to control the text style of the chart title. For example:

Note:

The easiest way to systematically alter the appearance of dashboards is to define and use themes, which are discussed in Defining and Using Themes. Themes use many of the options described in this page.

Customizing Fuel Gauges

### 7.7 Customizing Fuel Gauges

The fuel gauge is a narrow, vertical gauge with a needle that moves from left to right to indicate a value within a specific range (specified by Lower Range and Upper Range). The gauge distributes marks or “ticks” proportionally across its range, with Lower Range at left.

The fuel gauge displays its current value in a text box at the center of the gauge.

To customize a fuel gauge, access the Dashboard Editor, select the widget as described in Reconfiguring a Widget, click
Meters, click a meter name, and use the options listed there. The following options are available:

- Common options — See Customizing Meters, earlier in this page.

- Upper Range and Lower Range — Use these options to specify the range of values represented by tick marks on the fuel gauge.

color when the meter value is equal to or greater than Upper Threshold. For example:

- Lower Threshold — Use this option to add a warning light to the left side of the meter. This warning light changes
color when the meter value is equal to or lower than Lower Threshold. For example:

- Body Style — Use this submenu to control the outline and fill of the meter . For example:

Note:

The easiest way to systematically alter the appearance of dashboards is to define and use themes, which are discussed in Defining and Using Themes. Themes use many of the options described in this page.

### 7.8 Customizing Traffic Lights

The traffic light consists of three round lamps in a column. From top to bottom, the lamps are red, yello w, and green.

To customize a traffic light, access the Dashboard Editor , select the widget as described in Reconfiguring a Widget, click
Meters, click a meter name, and use the options listed there. The following options are available:

- Common options — See Customizing Meters, earlier in this page.

- Upper Range, Lower Range, Lower Threshold and Upper Threshold, — Use these options to control the three lamps in
the traffic light. If Upper Range is greater than Lower Range (the default), this meter is lit as follows:

– When the meter value is at or below Lower Threshold, the bottom lamp shows green.

– When the meter value is between Lower Threshold and Upper Threshold, the center lamp shows yellow.

– When the meter value is at or above Upper Threshold, the top lamp shows red.

The following figure demonstrates this logic:

Customizing Light Bars

This system is useful when a large number indicates a condition that requires attention.

Sometimes a low number indicates a condition that requires attention. If so, you can reverse the sense of the meter; to
do so, set Lower Range to a larger number than Upper Range. Then the red lamp indicates low values, and the green lamp indicates high values. When you reverse the range values, do not also reverse the threshold values.

- Body Style — Use this submenu to control the outline and fill of the meter . For example:

Note:

The easiest way to systematically alter the appearance of dashboards is to define and use themes, which are discussed in Defining and Using Themes. Themes use many of the options described in this page.

### 7.9 Customizing Light Bars

The light bar provides a stack of lamps arranged in a vertical bar. The light bar is similar to the traffic light, b ut its larger number of lamps provide a sense of movement from one end of the scale to the other.

lower...upperrangelower...upper...displayredlampdisplayyellowlampdisplaygreenlamp

To customize a light bar, access the Dashboard Editor, select the widget as described in Reconfiguring a Widget, click
Meters, click a meter name, and use the options listed there. The following options are available:

- Common options — See Customizing Meters, earlier in this page.

- Upper Range and Lower Range — Use these options to specify the range of values represented by the light bar.

The light bar is intended to appear “off” when the value is low, and fully lit when the value is high. The color of the bar shades from green (at the bottom of the scale) to yellow and red (at the top of the scale), implying that you should stop and address a problem when the value is high. This system is useful when a large number indicates a condition that requires attention.

Sometimes a low number indicates a condition that requires attention. If so, you can reverse the sense of the meter; to
do so, set Lower Range to a larger number than Upper Range. Then the fully lit lamp indicates low values, and the “off” lamp indicates high values. When you reverse the range values, do not also reverse the threshold values.

- Upper Threshold — Use this option to add a warning light to the upper end of the meter. This warning light changes
color when the meter value is equal to or greater than Upper Threshold. For example:

- Lower Threshold — Use this option to add a warning light to the lower end of the meter. This warning light changes
color when the meter value is equal to or lower than Lower Threshold. For example:

Customizing Smiley Faces

- Body Style — Use this submenu to control the outline and fill of the meter . For example:

Note:

The easiest way to systematically alter the appearance of dashboards is to define and use themes, which are discussed in Defining and Using Themes. Themes use many of the options described in this page.

### 7.10 Customizing Smiley Faces

The smiley face is the familiar yellow circle with two eyes and a smile. The mouth line changes depending on the value.

To customize a smiley face, access the Dashboard Editor, select the widget as described in Reconfiguring a Widget, click
Meters, click a meter name, and use the options listed there. The following options are available:

- Common options — See Customizing Meters, earlier in this page.

- Upper Range and Lower Range — Use these options to specify the range of values represented by the face, as follows:

–

The meter displays a smile when the meter value is near Upper Range.

–

–

The mouth is a horizontal line at the midpoint within the given range.

The meter displays a frown when the meter value is near Lower Range.

This system is useful when a large number indicates a positive condition, and a small number indicates a negative condition.

Sometimes a low number indicates a condition that requires attention. If so, you can reverse the sense of the meter. To do so, set Lower Range to a larger number than Upper Range. Then the smile occurs at low values, and the frown at high values.

- Persona — Use this option to control the type of face shown in this meter. For example:

Note:

The easiest way to systematically alter the appearance of dashboards is to define and use themes, which are discussed in Defining and Using Themes. Themes use many of the options described in this page.

Adding Columns

### 8.4 Adding Columns

A scorecard does not display any data until you add columns. A scorecard column is typically based on a property of the data source. In some cases, though, a scorecard column simply displays the item name or number and does not use a property of the data source.

To add a column to a scorecard:

1. Access the Dashboard Editor and select the widget as described in Reconfiguring a Widget.

2. Click Scorecard.

3. Click Columns.

The system displays a list of any columns defined for this scorecard. F or example:

4. Click the plus sign + button.

The system displays a dialog box where you specify the column.

5. For Value, select a property of the data source, type a numeric constant, or type a formula.

6. Optionally specify the following additional items:

- Label — Type a label or optionally click the check box to the right of Label. If you click the check box, the system
uses the localized name of this property as the label; this option applies only when Value is a data source property.

- If you type a label, note that you can include \n to force a line break in the label.

- Hidden — Select this option to hide this value.

- Value Column — Select this option to configure the v alue in this column as the value of the row. This value is
passed to any custom actions; see Specifying the Value of a Row.

Select this option for only one data property of the widget.

Format — Type a format string.

7. Click OK.

8. Configure the column as described in the rest of this page.

For information on deleting and rearranging columns, see Managing Widget Properties.

### 8.5 Configuring a Scorecard Column

To configure a scorecard column:

1. Access the Dashboard Editor and select the widget as described in Reconfiguring a Widget.

2. Click Scorecard.

3. Click Columns.

The system displays a list of any columns defined for this scorecard.

4. Select the column to configure.

5. Specify options as described after this list.

6. Save the dashboard.

The Display option controls most of the other choices for a property. For Display, you can choose one of the following:

The other options are as follows:

- Value — Specifies the v alue, if any, to display in this column. Select a property of the data source, type a numeric constant, or type a formula.

- You can omit this option if Display is Item Number or Label.

- Label — Specifies a header for this column. You can include \n to force a line break in this label.

Cell Caption — Specifies an optional caption to place within each cell in this column.

For example:

Configuring a Scorecard Column

- Header Align — Specifies ho w to align the column header for this column.

- Align — Specifies ho w to align the values in this column.

- Width — Specifies the width of this column.

You can also modify the widths of the columns in the Size & Appearance menu of the Dashboard Editor.

- Show As — Controls whether you display the value itself or the value as a percentage of another value, and so on.
Select one of the following:

–

–

–

–

Value — Displays Value. This is the default setting.

Conditional — Displays Value if the given property is defined. If the property is not defined, the column is not displayed.

Sum — Displays the sum of the values given by Value.

Target — Displays Target Value.

– % of Sum — Displays Value as a percentage of the total values given by Value.

– % of Target — Displays Value as a percentage of the Target Value for the same row.

- Summary — Controls what to display, if anything, in the footer, for this column. Select one of the following:

–

–

Sum — The summary value is the sum of the values in the column.

Avg — The summary value is the average of the values in the column.

– Max — The summary value is highest value in the column.

– Min — The summary value is the lowest value in the column.

–

Value — The summary value is specified in terms of the summary v alues for other columns. If you select this option, the system displays the Summary Value field. In this field, specify a
in the scorecard. For example:

formula that refers to other columns

=Sales-Cost

To refer to a column, use the name that you specified for the Label of the column.

Format — Specifies ho w to format numeric values in this column.

Style — Controls the color and line style of the graphical objects, if any, in this column. See Specifying Line Styles.

Min Value and Max Value — Specify the minimum and maximum values to display if the column displays plot boxes, described later in this page.

Min Value also affects arrows. Max Value also affects lamps.

Target Value — Specifies the v alue to compare with the data values. Select a property of the data source, type a numeric constant, or type a formula.

You can omit this if Display is Item Number or Label.

Lower and Upper — Control the appearance of plot boxes, described later in this page.

- Value Column — Select this if this column contains the value to pass to any custom actions.

- 8.6 Specifying a Scorecard Formula

- You can use formulas in the Value and Target Value options for a scorecard column. The rules are as follows:

- The first character must be an equals sign ( =)

- The formula can include the following pieces:

- – Names of data source properties (as given in the Value drop-down list)

- You must enclose the name in square brackets if it includes a space or any character that would be interpreted as an operator.

- For example:

=[Total Sales]/100

– Numeric constants such as 100

–

–

–

–

String constants such as "my string"

Standard mathematical operators: + (addition), - (subtraction), / (division), and * (multiplication)

Logical comparison operators: > (greater than), >= (greater than or equal to), = (equal to), < (less than), and <= (less than or equal to)

Parentheses

The values 0 and "0" are treated as false, and all other numeric and string values are treated as true.

- The formula can also include the following functions:

–

IF(test-value,value-if-test-true,value-if-test-false) evaluates a value (test-value) and returns value-if-test-true if the
logical value is true or returns value-if-test-false if the logical value is false.

For example, the following formula returns 25:

=IF(1,25,99)

The following formula returns either "abc" or "def" depending on the value of the PatCount property:

=IF(PatCount>1130,"abc","def")

– AND(value1,value2,value3, ... ) returns true if all the given values are true.

– OR(value1,value2,value3, ... ) returns true if at least one of the given values is true.

– CONCAT(value1,value2,value3, ... ) and returns the concatenation of the given values.

You can use formulas in the following locations as well:

- For a plot box, in the options Min Value, Max Value, Lower, Upper, and Base Value. See Adding Plot Boxes.

- For a column summary, in the Summary Value option. This option expresses the summary of a column in terms of the summaries for other columns.

In this case, the formula cannot refer to scorecard properties; instead it can refer to scorecard columns, using their
names given by the Label option.

Configuring a Column of Row Numbers

### 8.7 Configuring a Column of Row Numbers

A scorecard can include a column of row numbers, typically as the first column. The following shows an example:

To create such a column, add a column and configure it with the following options:

- Display — Select Item Number.

- The column will contain item numbers.

Label — Optionally specify the text to use as the column header. You can include \n to force a line break in this label.

### 8.8 Configuring a Column of Row Labels

A scorecard can include a column of row labels, typically as the first or second column. The following shows an example:

To create such a column, add a column and configure it with the following options:

- Display — Select Label.

- For a KPI, the column will contain the names of the rows, as shown on the KPI test page.

Label — Optionally type the text to use as the title. You can include \n to force a line break in this label.

### 8.9 Configuring a Column of Values

A typical scorecard includes columns that display numeric values, as in the following example:

To create such a column, add a column and configure it with the following options:

- Display — Click Value. This is the default setting.

- Value — Specify the value to display. Select a data source property, type a value, or type a formula.

- Label — Specify the text to use as the column header. You can include \n to force a line break in this label.

- Target Value — Optionally specify a target value for use as comparison with the given data value. Select a data source property, type a value, or type a formula.

- Show As — Use any option as described in Configuring a Scorecard Column .

- Format — Optionally specify a format string.

You use Value Column only when you configure custom actions that require ro w values. See Specifying the Value of a
Row.

### 8.10 Configuring Trend Lines and Trend Bars

A scorecard column can display trend lines or trend bars. The following shows an example of trend lines:

The following shows an example of trend bars:

Configuring Plot Boxes

To create such a column, add a column and configure it with the following options:

- Display — Click Trend Line or Trend Bar.

- Value — Specify the values to show in the trend line or trend bar. Select a data source property that contains a commaseparated list of values.

- Or type a comma-separated list of values.

- Label — Specify the text to use as the column header. You can include \n to force a line break in this label.

Show As — Click Value.

Tip: You can display trend lines and trend bars only for KPIs, because only KPIs can contain a column of comma-separated values. In an MDX-based KPI, you can use the %LIST function to build a comma-separated list.

### 8.11 Configuring Plot Boxes

A scorecard column can display plot boxes, as in the following example:

To create such a column, add a column and configure it with the following options:

- Display — Click Plot Box.

- Value — Specify the value to show in the plot box. Select a data source property, type a value, or type a formula.

- Label — Specify the text to use as the column header. You can include \n to force a line break in this label.

- Min Value — Optionally specify the minimum value to display in the plot boxes. The default is zero.

In the following example, Min Value is –5000, and Max Value is 5000:

- Max Value — Optionally specify the maximum value to display in the plot boxes. The default is the highest value displayed in the column. See the previous example.

- Lower — Optionally specify a value to divide the box into lower and middle bands. In the following example, Lower is 1000 and Upper is 4000. These options define three bands in the plot box es: a lower band (below 1000), a middle band (between 1000 and 4000), and an upper band (above 4000).

- Upper — Optionally specify a value to divide the box into middle and upper bands. See the previous example.

- Target Value — Optionally specify a target value for use as comparison with the given data value; the default is 0.
Select a data source property, type a value, or type a formula.

The plot box includes a vertical line to mark the target value, as follows:

To remove these vertical lines, set Target Value equal to a value that is out of range for the plot boxes.

Also see the Base Value option for an alternative way to use a comparison value.

- Base Value — Optionally specify a value to create a visual boundary in the plot boxes. The base value is used as follows:

–

–

If the actual column value is less than the base value, the bar is displayed in a contrasting color (red by default).

In all cases, the bar is drawn between the actual column value and the base value.

The following shows an example in which the base value is 0. This example includes an additional column that shows
the actual values used in the plot boxes:

Configuring Arrows

This plot box includes vertical lines at the value 0. The system draws these lines because Target Value is 0, the default.

The following shows another example in which the base value is 40:

### 8.12 Configuring Arrows

A scorecard column can display triangular arrows, shown in the following example:

Arrows provide a quick way to see where the given value falls, in a desired range. They work as follows:

- They use a data source property (or possibly a constant) as a source value.

- If the Min Value setting is less than zero, then:

–

–

If the source value is negative, an arrow is displayed as a downward pointing triangle.

If the source value equals zero, the arrow is not displayed.

–

If the source value is positive, an arrow is displayed as a upward pointing triangle.

- If the Min Value setting is greater than or equal to zero, then:

–

–

–

If the source value is less than Min Value, an arrow is displayed as a downward pointing triangle.

If the source value equals Min Value, the arrow is not displayed.

If the source value is greater than Min Value, an arrow is displayed as a upward pointing triangle.

To create such a column, add a column and configure it with the following options:

- Display — Select Arrow.

- Value — Specify the value to show in the arrow. Select a data source property, type a value, or type a formula.

- Label — Specify the text to use as the column header. You can include \n to force a line break in this label.

- Show As — Use any value as described in Configuring a Scorecard Column .

- Min Value — Specify the value to control the direction of the arrow as described above.

### 8.13 Configuring Lamps

A scorecard column can display round lamps, shown in the following example:

Lamps provide a quick way to see where the given value falls, in a desired range. They work as follows:

- They use a data source property (or possibly a constant) as a source value.

- If the source value is negative, the lamp is displayed as a red circle.

- If the source value equals zero, the lamp is not displayed.

- If the source value is positive, the lamp is displayed as a green circle.

- The opacity of the circle is determined by the absolute value of the source value, divided by the absolute value of Max Value. If Max Value is not specified, the lamp uses the lar gest value in the column.

To create such a column, add a column and configure it with the following options:

- Display — Select Lamp or Lamp with Value.

- Value — Specify the value to show in the lamp. Select a data source property, type a value, or type a formula.

- Label — Specify the text to use as the column header. You can include \n to force a line break in this label.

- Show As — Use any value as described in Configuring a Scorecard Column .

- Max Value — Specify the maximum value to control the opacity of the lamp, as described previously.

### 8.14 Customizing the Appearance of a Scorecard Widget

Defining and Using Themes

The easiest way to systematically alter the appearance of Business Intelligence dashboards is to define and use themes. This page describes how to do this.

### 10.1 Overview of Themes

To customize the appearance of your dashboards systematically, you can either specify a set of options for each widget in each dashboard or you can simply specify the theme that each widget uses. In the latter case, it is necessary only to specify the style options once, when you define the theme.

A single theme can specify the size of pivot table cells, the color and size of plot lines, background color and border, and
more. The following table summarizes how themes work:

Widget type

Options determined by the applied theme, if any

Pivot table widget in table format

All options in Table Settings; see Customizing the Appearance of a Pivot Table.

Pivot table widget in chart format

Most options* in Chart Settings > Titles & Labels, Chart Settings > Colors & Style, and Chart
Settings > Series Details; see Customizing the Appearance of a Chart Widget.

Speedometer

Most options* applicable to speedometers; see Customizing Speedometers.

Text meter

Fuel gauge

Traffic light

Light bar

Smiley face

Scorecard

Most options* applicable to text meters; see Customizing Text Meters.

Most options* applicable to fuel gauges; see Customizing Fuel Gauges.

Most options* applicable to traffic lights; see Customizing Traffic Lights.

Most options* applicable to light bars; see Customizing Light Bars.

Most options* applicable to smiley faces; see Customizing Smileys.

Most options* in the Scorecard section; see Customizing the Appearance of a Scorecard
Widget.

Other types

Theme has no effect

*In general, the exceptions are options that specify numeric values (such as the Upper Range and Lower Range options for a meter) and titles.

Defining and Using Themes

### 10.2 Creating a New Theme Definition

To create a new theme definition, possibly empty:

1. Access the Dashboard Editor and select a widget as described in Reconfiguring a Widget.

If the dashboard contains a widget with styles that you would like to use in the theme, select that widget. Or if no widgets have any styles (yet) that you would like to use, select any widget.

3. For New Theme, type the name of the theme.

4. Click OK.

The system creates and saves the theme. The theme contains style settings, if any, copied from the widget. It also updates the widget to remove the local style settings and to use the theme instead, and it saves the dashboard. The system then redisplays the dashboard.

### 10.3 Adding Style Information to a Theme

To add style information to a theme:

1. Access the Dashboard Editor and select the widget that includes the styles that you want to use.

3. For Existing Theme, select the theme.

4. Click OK.

The system copies style settings, if any, from the widget to the theme and saves the theme. It also updates the widget to remove the local style settings and to use the theme instead, and it saves the dashboard. The system then redisplays the dashboard.

### 10.4 Applying a Theme

To apply a theme to a different widget:

1. Access the Dashboard Editor and select the widget as described in Reconfiguring a Widget.

2. Click Type and Data Source.

3. Click Widget Theme.

4. Click the name of the theme.

The system immediately updates the widget, saves the dashboard, and redisplays the dashboard.

Deleting a Theme

### 10.5 Deleting a Theme

To delete a theme:

1. Access the Dashboard Editor and select any widget as described in Reconfiguring a Widget.

2. Click Type and Data Source.

3. Click Widget Theme.

4. Click the X next to the name of the theme.

5. Click OK to confirm this change.

The system deletes the theme but does not change any dashboards. Any dashboards that use this theme now revert to their default appearance.

This page describes how to add controls to widgets in a Business Intelligence dashboard.

For examples of controls and information on where they can be used, see Orientation to Dashboards.

Note:

The following buttons are not controls and are not discussed in this page:

Button

Discussion

Opens the pivot table in the Mini Analyzer.

Displays the widget in table format.

Displays the widget in chart format.

Exports the currently viewed data to Microsoft Excel.

4. Specify the options as appropriate for the type of control you need, as described in the rest of this page.

5. Click OK to add the control.

6. Optionally save the dashboard.

For reference, this section lists the control options and describes their purposes.

- Location — Specifies where the control is sho wn:

– Widget (the default) displays the control on the widget toolbar.

Note:

If you add a control to the widget, be sure the toolbar is visible (its display is controlled via the Toolbar option). See Reconfiguring a Widget.

–

Dashboard displays the control in the Filters worklist.

Do not use Dashboard if you have configured this as a zero-w orklist dashboard, because the control would not be visible to users.

–

Onclick Event configures the control as an onclick control. No visible indication of the control is gi ven.

- Target — Specifies which widgets this control af fects. Specify one of the following:

–

–

–

If this option is blank, the control affects only the widget that owns it.

If this option is *, the control affects all widgets.

If this option is the name of the widget, the control affects that widget. In this case, use the value given in the Widget Name option for that widget.

- Action — Specifies the action. Custom actions are sho wn at the end of the list.

- DataSource — Enables you to provide a control that displays a different pivot table. (Note that this option is available only when you reconfigure a control). See Adding a Control to Display a Different Pivot Table.

- Filter — (if Action is Filter) Specifies the filter for this control to use.

- Type — Specifies the visual form of the control:

- –

- –

- – – –

–

–

auto — The system chooses the suitable form based on your other selections.

dropdown — The control is shown as a drop-down list.

searchBox — The control is shown as a searchable drop-down list. The user can type a value and then search for values that match the input.

radio — The control is shown as a set of radio buttons.

Note that the radio option is available only when you reconfigure a control.

button — The control is shown as a button.

hidden — The control is not shown.

custom — The control is based on a custom portlet.

Custom control — (if Type is custom) — Specifies the portlet to use.

Control Label or Icon — Specifies either the te xt to display above the control or an icon to display next to the control. For information on adding icons that can be used here, see Creating Icons.

Active When — Specifies when this control is acti ve. Choose one of the following values:

–

Always — This control is always active.

Reconfiguring a Control

–

–

–

Item Selected — This control is active when the user selects one or more cells in a pivot table. The control is inactive otherwise.

## 1 Listing Item Selected — This control is active when the user selects a single row of a listing. The control is inactive otherwise.

Listing Item Selected — This control is active when the user selects one or more rows of a listing. The control is inactive otherwise.

- Control Tooltip — Specifies a tooltip to display when the user ho vers the cursor over the control.

- Control Size — Specifies the width of the control.

- Read Only — If selected, this option prevents a user from changing the value in this control.

- In this case, the purpose of the control is to indicate the state of the control. Either provide a default value (if applicable) or pass a value via the dashboard URL. See Accessing Dashboards from Your Application.

- Default Value (applies only to filter controls) — Specifies the def ault filter v alue. See Adding an Explicit Filter Control.

Required (applies only to filter controls) — If this option is enabled, the user must specify a v alue for the filter . See Adding an Explicit Filter Control, later in this page.

Note that you must also specify Default Value so that the dashboard always has a value for this filter .

InterSystems recommends that widgets that are the target of controls on other widgets do not have their own controls. Additionally, where possible, you should try to avoid spreading controls among many different widgets on a dashboard.

Not all combinations of these options are suitable. This page provides recommended configurations for specific kinds of controls.

### 11.2 Reconfiguring a Control

To reconfigure a control on a widget:

1. Access the Dashboard Editor and select the widget as described in Reconfiguring a Widget.

2. Click Controls.

3. Click the control name.

4. Make changes as needed. See the previous section for details.

5. Optionally save the dashboard.

### 11.3 Adding an Explicit Filter Control

To add a control to filter one or more widgets, add a control as described earlier in this page and configure it as follo ws:

- Location — Select either Widget (the default) or Dashboard.

- Target — If this control is going to automatically refresh the display, do one of the following:

–

–

Leave this option blank, if you want to refresh only this widget. This is the default.

Specify * to refresh all widgets.

–

Specify the name of the widget to refresh (use the value given in the Widget Name option for that widget).

- Action — Select one of the following:

–

–

Apply Filter sets the filter and automatically refreshes the display .

Set Filter sets the filter b ut does not refresh the display.

- Filter — Select the filter for this control to use:

–

For a pivot table created in the Analyzer, the system lists all levels available in the same subject area.

If there are any named filters in the subject area, the list include the item Named Filters. If you select this option, the user will be able to select any one of those named filters.

–

–

For a KPI, the system lists all filters defined in the KPI.

For a production business metric, the list includes Instance (the instance to display), MaxHistory (the number of historical points to display for the properties that specify AUTOHISTORY), and Properties (the metric property to display).

- Type — Select auto, dropdown, or searchBox.

- Control Label or Icon — Optionally type the text that you want to display above the control. Or select an icon to display next to the control.

- Read Only — Optionally select this to prevent the users from changing the filter . In this case, the purpose of the filter is to indicate how the data is filtered. Either pro vide a default value or pass a filter v alue via the dashboard URL. See Accessing Dashboards from Your Application.

- Value Required — If the user must specify a value for this filter , enable the Required option. Also specify a value for Default Value so that the dashboard always has a value for this filter .

- Control Tooltip — Optionally type a tooltip to display when the user hovers the cursor over the control.

#### 11.3.1 Specifying a Default Value

You may optionally type a value into Default Value.

Alternatively, click the magnifying glass. The system displays the following dialog box:

Here do one of the following:

- Click the magnifying glass under Select a filter value and select a value in the resulting dialog.

- Type a value in the Enter an MDX Key field. See the table after this list.

- Select a value from the Use a run-time variable drop-down list, which lists all available runtime variables. (For details on creating these, see Implementing InterSystems Business Intelligence.) Adding an OnClick Filter Control Then click OK.

If you select a runtime variable, it is shown in the Default Value field with an at sign ( @) at the beginning. For example:
@DefaultZipCode

Note:

The system assumes that the filter v alue is a member key rather than a member name. In most cases, the member key and member name are the same. For information on seeing the member key, see Finding the Key for a
Member.

Also, if a user accesses the dashboard via a URL, any filter v alues in the URL take precedence over the default value specified in this control.

If you type a value into the Enter an MDX Key field, use one of the follo wing forms:

Scenario

A single member

Expression That Returns This Value

"&[keyval]" where keyval is the key for the member. See Key Values in the InterSystems MDX Reference.

A range of members

"&[keyval1]:&[keyval2]"

A set of members

"{&[keyval1],&[keyval2],&[keyval3]}"

All members of the level except for a specified single member

All members of the level except for a specified subset

"%NOT &[keyval]"

"%NOT{&[keyval1],&[keyval2],&[keyval3]}"

### 11.4 Adding an OnClick Filter Control

Note:

An onclick filter control is supported only in a widget that uses a pi vot table as its data source.

To add an onclick filter control, add a control as described earlier in this page and configure it as follo ws:

- Location — Click Onclick Event.

- Target — Do one of the following:

–

–

Specify * to refresh all widgets.

Specify the name of the widget to refresh (use the value given in the Widget Name option for that widget).

- Action — Select Apply Filter.

Note:

You do not need to select the filter to apply . The system automatically filters based on the complete conte xt
in which the user selects; that is, the system considers the row and column context as well as any currently
active filters applied to the widget. Furthermore, if you do specify a filter within the widget configuration, that filter is ignored.

#### 11.4.1 Example: Listing with OnClick Filter

As an example, see the sample dashboard Listing with OnClick Filter. This dashboard is defined as follo ws:

- In the dashboard definition, the upper widget has an onclick filter whose tar get is the lower widget.

- The pivot table shown in the top widget — Use in Dashboards/Product Info — displays product categories as rows.

- The pivot table shown in the bottom widget — Use in Dashboards/HoleFoods Sales Listing — is defined as an unfiltered
detail listing that does not auto-execute. To define a pi vot table in this way, do the following in the Analyzer:

1. Create a pivot table that uses the desired cube and that has no column or row definition and that also has no filter

,

like this:

2. Clear the Auto-execute button.

3.

Click the listing button

.

You can perform steps 2 and 3 in either order.

4. Save this pivot table.

### 11.5 Adding a Refresh Control

To add a control to refresh the dashboard (which is necessary if you have controls that set filters but that do not apply them
automatically), add a control as described earlier in this page and configure it as follo ws:

- Location — Select either Widget (the default) or Dashboard.

- Target — Do one of the following:

- –

- – – Leave this option blank, if you want to refresh only this widget. This is the default.

Specify * to refresh all widgets.

Specify the name of the widget to refresh (use the value given in the Widget Name option for that widget).

Action — Select Refresh.

Type — Select auto or timer.

–

–

If you select auto, the control appears as follows:

If you select timer, type a value into Time (in seconds). In this case, the refresh control will automatically run at the specified interv al.

- Control Tooltip — Optionally type a tooltip to display when the user hovers the cursor over the button.

Tip:

To use a custom button instead of the standard icon, specify the Type as button and specify a value for Control Label or Icon.

Adding a Control to Print the Dashboard

### 11.6 Adding a Control to Print the Dashboard

You can add controls with which users can print parts or all of the dashboard. The output is a PDF file (opened in a bro wser window) with one page for each widget.

To add such a control, add a control as described earlier in this page and configure it as follo ws:

- Location — Select either Widget (the default) or Dashboard.

- Target — Specify a list of the names of the widgets to print. The first widget in the list determines the print settings.

- Or, if you want to print all the widgets and do not need to control the print settings, type *.

- If you leave Target, only the current widget is printed. If you need only to print a single widget, however, it is simpler
to just enable the print setting for that widget; see Customizing Print Settings for a Widget.

- Action — Select Print Widget.

- Type — Select auto, dropdown, or button, as applicable for the chosen action.

The default type is a small button with a picture on it.

Control Label or Icon — Optionally type the text that you want to display on the control. Or select an icon to display next to the control.

Control Tooltip — Optionally type a tooltip to display when the user hovers the cursor over the control.

Then save the dashboard.

For further details and requirements, see the section Customizing Print Settings for a Widget.

### 11.7 Adding a Control to Reload the Dashboard

To add a control to reload the dashboard, add a control as described earlier in this page and configure it as follo ws:

- Location — Select either Widget (the default) or Dashboard.

- Target — Ignore this option. All widgets are refreshed.

- Action — Select Reload Dashboard.

- Type — Select auto or timer.

–

–

If you select auto, the control appears as follows:

If you select timer, type a value into Time (in seconds). In this case, the reload control will automatically run at the specified interv al.

- Control Tooltip — Optionally type a tooltip to display when the user hovers the cursor over the button.

Tip:

To use a custom button instead of the standard icon, specify the Type as button and specify a value for Control Label or Icon.

### 11.8 Adding a Control to Change the Display Type

You can add controls with which users can change the display type from one chart to another. You can provide two different
kinds of controls:

- A drop-down list from which the user can choose a type.

- A button that immediately switches to a different type. In this case, you typically provide at least two buttons, so that the user can easily return to the original type.

To add such a control, add a control as described earlier in this page and configure it as follo ws:

- Location — Select either Widget (the default) or Dashboard.

- Target — Leave this blank. Or type * if this control should affect all widgets in this dashboard.

- Action — Select Set Chart Type or Choose Chart Type. The first option adds a b utton (which you configure later) to set the display type to a specific type. The second option adds a drop-down list (which you configure later) of display types.

- Type — Select auto, dropdown, or button, as applicable for the chosen action.

- For Set Chart Type, the default type is dropdown, and for Choose Chart Type, the default type is a small button with a picture on it.

- Control Label or Icon — Optionally type the text that you want to display on the control. Or select an icon to display next to the control.

Control Tooltip — Optionally type a tooltip to display when the user hovers the cursor over the control.

Then select the control again and display the Control menu. Select Chart Type. This displays a list of chart types, which
includes the pivot table type. Then:

- If Action is Set Chart Type, click a single type.

- If Action is Choose Chart Type, click multiple types and then click Apply Selection.

To unselect a given type, click it a second time. To unselect all types, click Clear Selection.

Then save the dashboard.

### 11.9 Adding a Control to Change the Row or Column Sort

In a pivot table widget, if a user double-clicks a column header in a pivot table, the system automatically sorts the pivot table by the data in that column. No configuration is needed for this.

You can also add a control that affects the row or column sort. To add such a control, add a control as described earlier in
this page and configure it as follo ws:

Location — Select either Widget (the default) or Dashboard.

Target — Leave this blank. Or type * if this control should affect all widgets in this dashboard.

Action — Select Row Sort or Column Sort.

Type — Select auto (which becomes a drop-down list) or dropdown.

- Adding a Control to Change the Row or Column Count

- Control Label or Icon — Optionally type the text that you want to display on the control. Or select an icon to display next to the control.

- Control Tooltip — Optionally type a tooltip to display when the user hovers the cursor over the control.

- 11.10 Adding a Control to Change the Row or Column
Count

- For pivot table widgets, to add a control that changes the row or column count, add a control as described earlier in this
page and configure it as follo ws:

- Location — Select either Widget (the default) or Dashboard.

- Target — Leave this blank. Or type * if this control should affect all widgets in this dashboard.

- Action — Select Row Count or Column Count.

- Type — Select auto (which becomes a type-in box) or dropdown.

- Control Label or Icon — Optionally type the text that you want to display on the control. Or select an icon to display next to the control.

- Control Tooltip — Optionally type a tooltip to display when the user hovers the cursor over the control.

- 11.11 Adding a Control to Change the Row or Column
Specification

For widgets that display pivot tables (rather than other data sources), you can add a control that enables the user to change the specification for the ro ws or columns of the pivot table. To add such a control, add a control as described earlier in this
page and configure it as follo ws:

- Location — Select either Widget (the default) or Dashboard.

- Target — Leave this blank. Or type * if this control should affect all widgets in this dashboard.

- Action — Select Set Row Spec or Set Column Spec.

- Type — Select auto (which becomes a button) or select button.

- Row Spec or Column Spec (as appropriate; this option is available only when you reconfigure a control) — Specify an
MDX set expression. For example:

[gend].[h1].[gender].MEMBERS

For another example:

{MEASURES.[avg test score],MEASURES.[avg allergy count]}

Do not include the keyword NON EMPTY. Also note that the set expression does not include ON ROWS or ON COLUMNS.

For details, see Set Expressions.

If this setting is an empty string, the system ignores the specification and uses the specification defined in the original data source.

Control Label or Icon — Optionally type the text that you want to display on the control. Or select an icon to display next to the control.

Control Tooltip — Optionally type a tooltip to display when the user hovers the cursor over the control.

- Note:

- Such controls are supported only for widgets that use pivot tables as the data source. Also note that it is not practical to use Set Column Spec or Choose Column Spec (see the subsection) with meters and scorecards because these options change the property names of the data source.

#### 11.11.1 Variation: Providing a List of Choices

To provide a similar control that provides a list of choices for the row or column specification:

1. Create a term list to hold the choices.

For each term list item, specify Key as the name of the specification and specify Value as an MDX set expression. For
example:

2. Use the preceding steps, with the following changes:

- Action — Select Choose Row Spec or Choose Column Spec.

- Type — Select auto (which becomes a drop-down list), dropdown, or radio (if there is a small number of choices). The radio option is available only when you reconfigure a control.

- Row Spec List or Choose Column Spec (as appropriate; this option is available only when you reconfigure a control)
— Select the term list that you created for this purpose.

### 11.12 Adding a Control to Set a Pivot Variable

Pivot variables provide another way for your end users to interact with your dashboards. A pivot table can be defined so that its underlying query uses pivot variables in selected parts of the query. (Similarly, an MDX-based KPI can use pivot variables in the same way.) When a dashboard includes this pivot table, that dashboard can include a pivot variable control, with which the user can change the value of the corresponding pivot variable. The system simply substitutes the given value into the query, executes the query, and then redisplays the pivot table.

To add a control to set a pivot variable, add a control as described earlier in this page and configure it as follo ws:

- Action — Select Apply Pivot Variable.

- Pivot Variable — Select the pivot variable.

- Control Label or Icon — Optionally type the text that you want to display on the control. Or select an icon to display next to the control.

- Control Tooltip — Optionally type a tooltip to display when the user hovers the cursor over the control.

The control is useful only if the data source for the widget uses the given pivot variable.

Adding a Control to Display a Different Pivot Table

### 11.13 Adding a Control to Display a Different Pivot Table

For a pivot table widget, you can provide a control that displays a different pivot table as the data source. The original data source does not have to be a pivot table. To add a control to display a specific pi vot table in a widget, add a control as
described earlier in this page and configure it as follo ws:

- Location — Select either Widget (the default) or Dashboard.

- Target — Leave this blank.

- Action — Select Set Data Source.

- DataSource (this option is available only when you reconfigure a control) — Select the pivot table.

- Type — Select auto or button.

- Control Tooltip — Optionally type a tooltip to display when the user hovers the cursor over the control.

Note:

Such controls are supported only for pivot table widgets.

#### 11.13.1 Variation: Providing a List of Choices

To provide a similar control that provides a list of choices:

1. Create a term list to hold the choices.

For each term list item, specify Key as the name of the specification and specify Value as the name of a pivot table, ending with .pivot

For example:

2. Use the preceding steps, with the following changes:

- Action — Select Choose Data Source.

- Type — Select auto (which becomes a drop-down list), dropdown, or radio (if there is a small number of choices).

- DataSource List (this option is available only when you reconfigure a control) — Select the term list that you created for this purpose.

### 11.14 Adding a Control to Display a Listing

You can display listings from any pivot table widget whose data source defines a listing.

Important:

A map listing uses the Google Maps API. Be sure that your usage of this API is consistent with the Terms of Use, which you can access via a link displayed in this listing.

Note that in order to use the Google Maps API, you must obtain an API key. See Specifying Basic Settings for more information.

To add a control that displays a listing, add a control as described earlier in this page and configure it as follo ws:

- Location — Select either Widget (the default) or Dashboard.

- Target — Leave this blank.

- Action — Select Show Listing or Show Geo Listing (which shows a map listing).

- Then choose the listing from the drop-down list to the right.

Type — Select auto.

For a regular listing, this control appears as follows:

For a map listing, this control appears as follows:

- Control Tooltip — Optionally type a tooltip to display when the user hovers the cursor over the control.

Tip:

To use a custom button instead of the standard icon, specify the Type as button and specify a value for Control Label or Icon.

### 11.15 Adding a Control to Display the Pivot Analysis Window

For a widget that displays a pivot table, you can add a control that displays the Pivot Analysis window. To add such a
control, add a control as described earlier in this page and configure it as follo ws:

- Location — Select either Widget (the default) or Dashboard.

- Target — Leave this blank.

- Action — Select Pivot Analysis.

- Analysis — Select the analysis option to display, from the following:

–

–

–

–

Cluster — Performs a cluster analysis.

Distribution — Performs a distribution analysis.

Regression — Performs a regression analysis.

Content Analysis — Performs a Text Analytics content analysis. This option is available only if the pivot table is based on a subject area that includes unstructured data.

Adding a Control to Display Another Dashboard

–

Entity Analysis — Performs a Text Analytics entity analysis. This option is available only if the pivot table is based on a subject area that includes unstructured data.

For information on these options, see Using the Pivot Analysis Window.

If you do not choose an option, the user can select any option. If you do choose an option, the user sees only that option.

- Type — Select auto (which is shown as the

- button in this case).

Control Tooltip — Optionally type a tooltip to display when the user hovers the cursor over the control.

### 11.16 Adding a Control to Display Another Dashboard

To add a control that displays another dashboard, add a control as described earlier in this page and configure it as follo ws:

- Location — Select either Widget (the default) or Dashboard.

- Target — Leave this blank.

- Action — Select View Dashboard.

- Dashboard — Click the Search button

- , click the dashboard, and click OK.

- Type — Select button or auto (which is shown as a button in this case).

- Control Label or Icon — Optionally type the text that you want to display on the control. Or select an icon to display next to the control.

Control Tooltip — Optionally type a tooltip to display when the user hovers the cursor over the control.

Note:

You can also configure a pi vot table widget so that you can double-click a cell and drill to another dashboard. See Adding Pivot Table Widgets.

#### 11.16.1 Passing Values

To pass values from a dashboard to a web page, include the following tokens in the URL:

$$$VALUELIST

The system replaces this token with a comma-separated set of values for the selected rows of the widget, as follows:

- For a scorecard widget, the values are taken from the property that is configured with Value Column.

- For a pivot table widget that displays a listing, the values are taken from the listing IDs.

- For a pivot table widget that displays a KPI, the values are taken from the property that is configured with Value Column, if any. Otherwise the values are taken from the first column.

- In other scenarios, $$$VALUELIST does not have values.

The values are assumed not to contain commas.

As a simple example, the URL could be as follows:

http://www.google.com/search?q=$$$VALUELIST

$$$CURRVALUE

The system replaces this token with the current value of the widget, as follows:

- For a scorecard widget, the value is taken from the property that is configured with Value Column.

- For a pivot table widget that displays a detail listing, the value is taken from the first selected cell that w as displayed before the listing was shown.

- For other pivot table widgets, the value is taken from the first selected cell.

- In other scenarios, $$$CURRVALUE does not have values.

Note:

$$$VALUELIST and $$$CURRVALUE are not macros. They are replaced at run time, not at compile time.

### 11.17 Adding a Control to Display a Web Page

To add a control that displays a web page, add a control as described earlier in this page and configure it as follo ws:

- Location — Select either Widget (the default) or Dashboard.

- Target — Leave this blank.

- Action — Select Navigate.

- URL — Type the URL.

- Type — Select button or auto (which is shown as a button in this case).

- Control Label or Icon — Optionally type the text that you want to display on the button. Or select an icon to display next to the control.

- Control Tooltip — Optionally type a tooltip to display when the user hovers the cursor over the control.

### 11.18 Adding a Control to Perform a Custom Action

To add a control that performs a custom action, add a control as described earlier in this page and configure it as follo ws:

- Location — Select Widget (the default), Dashboard, or Onclick Event.

- Target — Leave this blank.

- Action — Select the custom action. The custom actions are at the end of the list.

- For information on creating custom actions, see Implementing InterSystems Business Intelligence.

- Type — Select an option as follows:

- – If Location is Widget or Dashboard, select button or auto (which is shown as a button in this case).

– Otherwise, ignore Type.

Control Label or Icon — Optionally type the text that you want to display on the button. Or select an icon to display next to the control.

Control Tooltip — Optionally type a tooltip to display when the user hovers the cursor over the control.

Hiding a Control

#### 11.18.1 Specifying the Value of a Row

In some cases, a custom action might require information about the context — that is, the row that the user selected before launching the action. (Other actions operate the same way no matter what the context is.) When you use custom actions, make sure that you know whether this context is required.

If a custom action requires context, do the following to specify which column contains the value to pass to the actions:

1.

Identify the column or property to use as the value.

2. Reconfigure that column or property and select the Value Column option.

Do not select the Value Column option for more than one property or column in the same widget; if you do, the result is
indeterminate.

### 11.19 Hiding a Control

Sometimes it is useful to add a control, specify a default value, and hide it. To hide a control, for Type, select Hidden.
