# InterSystems IRIS Demo: .NET Object Persistence with

Persistence with XEP

This article introduces the XEP API, which provides support for extremely fast .NET object storage and retrieval on Inter- Systems IRIS® data platform. It gives you a high level overview of the XEP approach to .NET object persistence, and walks you through a simple scenario that demonstrates the main features of the API.

These activities are designed to use only the default settings and features so that you can acquaint yourself with the fundamentals of XEP without having to deal with details that are beyond the scope of this overview. For the full documentation on XEP, see Persisting .NET Objects with InterSystems XEP.

## 1 Rapid Object Storage and Retrieval

Object-oriented programming is at the core of the .NET framework, so it is natural for .NET applications to model data as objects. However, this can cause problems when the application needs to store that data in a database. If you use ADO.NET to store and retrieve objects, you are faced with the problem of transforming your object data into a set of relational tables, and then transforming query resultsets back into objects. The usual solution to this problem is to use an object-relational mapping (ORM) framework such as Entity Framework to automate the process. InterSystems IRIS does offer an Entity Framework interface, and InterSystems recommends it for large, complex object hierarchies. On the other hand, for applications that perform tasks such as real-time data acquisition, the main problem is speed rather than data complexity. Although Entity Framework is by no means slow (if properly optimized), XEP is a better alternative for tasks that require extremely fast storage and retrieval of simple or moderately complex data. In most cases, it will be considerably faster than either Entity Framework or ADO.NET.

## 2 How Does XEP Work?

XEP is a lightweight .NET API that projects .NET object data as persistent events. A persistent event is an instance of an InterSystems IRIS class (normally a subclass of %Persistent) containing a copy of the data fields in a .NET object. Lik e any such instance, it can be retrieved by object access, SQL query, or direct global access.

Before a persistent event can be created and stored, XEP must analyze the corresponding .NET class and import a schema into the database. A schema defines the structure of the persistent e vent class that will be used to store the .NET objects. Importing the schema automatically creates a corresponding ObjectScript schema for the persistent event class if one does not already exist. The information from the analysis may be all that XEP needs to import a simple schema. For more complex structures, you can supply additional information that allows XEP to generate indexes and to override the default rules for importing fields.

After the schema has been created for a class, you can use various XEP methods to store, update, or delete events, run SQL queries, and iterate through query resultsets.

## 3 Try It! Hands-on with XEP

Now it’s time for you to try out XEP for yourself. This XepSimple demo is a very small program, but it provides examples for most of the key XEP features and will give you an overview of how the XEP API is used.

### 3.1 Before You Begin

To use the procedure, you will need a Windows system to work on, with the .NET framework and Visual Studio installed, and a running InterSystems IRIS instance to connect to. Your choices for InterSystems IRIS include several types of licensed
and free evaluation instances; the instance need not be hosted by the system you are working on (although they must have
network access to each other). For information on how to deploy each type of instance if you do not already have one to work with, see Deploying InterSystems IRIS in InterSystems IRIS Basics: Connecting an IDE. Connect Visual Studio to your InterSystems IRIS instance using the information in InterSystems IRIS Connection Information and .Net IDEs in the same document.

#### 3.1.1 Configuring the Visual Studio Project

To begin, open Visual Studio and create a new console app project, selecting the Visual C# and Console App (.NET Framework) options. For the Name field, enter netxep.

#### 3.1.2 Adding the Assembly Reference

The XEP API is packaged into the InterSystems.Data.XEP.dll library, which must be installed on your local system. You can download the assembly from the InterSystems IRIS Driver Packages page. If InterSystems IRIS is installed on your local machine or another you have access to, you can find the file in installation directory for the instance.

install-dir\dev\dotnet\bin\v4.5, where install-dir is the

To add an assembly reference to InterSystems.Data.XEP.dll to your project:

1. From the Visual Studio main menu, select Project > Add Reference...

2.

3. Browse to the location of the InterSystems.Data.XEP.dll file.

4. Select the file and click Add.

5. Click OK.

In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer, the InterSystems.Data.XEP.dll assembly should now be listed under References.

### 3.2 Adding a Sample Class

Before creating the program source file, you will add a class that the main program will access to generate sample objects for storage. In Visual Studio, use Project > Add Class to add a C# class file to the netxep project. Delete the default contents of the class file, and cop y and paste the following code into the file.

using System;

namespace xep.samples
{
public class SingleStringSample {
public string name;
public SingleStringSample() { }
internal SingleStringSample(string str) {
name = str;
}

public static SingleStringSample[] generateSampleData(int objectCount) {
SingleStringSample[] data = new SingleStringSample[objectCount];
for (int i = 0; i < objectCount; i++)
{
data[i] = new SingleStringSample("single string test");
}
return data;
}
}
}

Because this class is very simple, XEP does not need any annotations to generate an effective schema from it. For more complex classes in a real-world application, you can use various options to optimize the import.

### 3.3 Creating the XEP Demo Program

Now you are ready to create the XEPSimple demo program. In Visual Studio, find the def ault program.cs file that w as created when you created the project. Delete the default contents of the file and paste in the code that follo ws, substituting the connection information for your InterSystems IRIS instance for the values of the host, port, irisnamespace, username, and password variables. You can specify the USER namespace as shown, or you can choose another that you have created on your installed instance.

using System;
using InterSystems.XEP;
using xep.samples;

namespace XepSimpleNamespace
{
public class XepSimple
{
public static void Main(string[] args)
{
// Generate 12 SingleStringSample objects for use as test data
SingleStringSample[] sampleArray = SingleStringSample.generateSampleData(12);

// EventPersister
EventPersister xepPersister = PersisterFactory.CreatePersister();

String host = "127.0.0.1"; // InterSystems IRIS host
int port = 51774; // InterSystems IRIS Superserver port
String irisnamespace = "USER"; // InterSystems IRIS namespace
String username = "_system"; // Credentials for InterSystems IRIS
String password = "SYS"; //Credentials for InterSystems IRIS

xepPersister.Connect(host,port,irisnamespace,username,password); // connect to localhost
xepPersister.DeleteExtent("xep.samples.SingleStringSample"); // remove old test data
xepPersister.ImportSchema("xep.samples.SingleStringSample"); // import flat schema

// Event
Event xepEvent = xepPersister.GetEvent("xep.samples.SingleStringSample");
xepEvent.Store(sampleArray);

// EventQuery
EventQuery<SingleStringSample> xepQuery = null;
String sqlQuery = "SELECT * FROM xep_samples.SingleStringSample WHERE %ID BETWEEN ? AND
?";
xepQuery = xepEvent.CreateQuery<SingleStringSample>(sqlQuery);
xepQuery.AddParameter(3); // assign value 3 to first SQL parameter
xepQuery.AddParameter(12); // assign value 12 to second SQL parameter
xepQuery.Execute(); // get resultset for IDs between 3 and 12

// Print each item in the resultset
SingleStringSample mySample = xepQuery.GetNext();
while (mySample != null){
Console.WriteLine(mySample.name);
mySample = xepQuery.GetNext();
}

xepQuery.Close();
xepEvent.Close();
xepPersister.Close();
} // end main()
} // end class xepSimple
}

The demo program is divided into three sections, each of which demonstrates one of the three main XEP classes,
EventPersister, Event, and EventQuery. When run, the XepSimple demo program performs the following tasks:

- First, some sample objects are generated by calling a method of your sample data class, xep.samples.SingleStringSample.

- EventPersister is the main entry point for XEP, and provides the connection to the database.

- It creates an instance named xepPersister, which establishes a TCP/IP connection to the User namespace in the database and deletes any existing sample data. It then calls ImportSchema() to analyze the sample class and send the schema to the database, thus creating an the corresponding ObjectScript schema to hold persistent SingleStringSample objects.

- Event encapsulates an interface between a .NET object and the corresponding database object.

Once the schema has been generated, xepPersister can create an Event object named xepEvent for the sample class. The Store() method stores the array of .NET objects as persistent events.

EventQuery is used to prepare and execute a limited subset of SQL queries.

An EventQuery<SingleStringSample> object named xepQuery is created by passing a query string to the xepEvent object’s CreateQuery() method. The string defines an SQL query that accepts tw o parameters (the ? characters). The parameter values are defined by calls to AddParameter(), and a call to Execute() fetches the query resultset.

- When processing is done, it cleans up by calling the close() methods for the XEP objects.

### 3.4 Running the XEPSimple Program

You are now ready to build and run the XEPSimple demo program. Press Ctrl + F5 to run the program so the command prompt stays open when the program ends.

## 4 Next Steps

The XepSimple demo is designed to give you a taste of XEP without bogging you down in details, and is not a model for real production code — it didn’t even bother with exception checking. The most important simplification w as in the sample data. You persisted a few tiny .NET objects from a class that doesn’t require annotation or other mechanisms to aid in schema generation and optimization. Though you usually need annotations and other options in a real world application, these options are straightforward and easy to use. The APIs are similarly simple and easy to use.
