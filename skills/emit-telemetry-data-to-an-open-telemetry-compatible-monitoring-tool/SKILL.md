# Emit Telemetry Data to an OpenTelemetry-Compatible

Tool

OpenTelemetry (OTel) is an open source framework and toolkit for generating, exporting, and collecting telemetry data.

On supported systems, this version of InterSystems IRIS leverages the OpenTelemetry C++ SDK to provide support for exporting and emitting telemetry data as OpenTelemetry Protocol signals over HTTP (OTLP/HTTP) to the OpenTelemetry Collector or any other compatible monitoring tool.

Note:

This feature is not available for macOS, Windows, and AIX systems in this version of InterSystems IRIS.

You can configure InterSystems IRIS to emit the follo wing types of signals:

- Metrics — the measurements which you have configured the InterSystems IRIS /api/monitor API to collect.

- Logs — events which InterSystems IRIS records to either the system messages log or the audit database.

- Traces — information about how a request moves through your application.

To learn more about how these different types of signals work within OTel, refer to the OTel documentation’s pages for metrics, logs, and traces.

InterSystems IRIS pushes these signals to the endpoint that you specify, as described in Configure the Target Endpoint.
InterSystems IRIS emits metrics and logs at a regular interval, based on a common configuration parameter; otherwise,
you can enable and configure the emission of each type of signal independently , as described in the corresponding sections which follow.

Tip:

The OpenTelemetry Collector provides various debugging tools that can help you as you configure your InterSystems IRIS instance to emit signals, regardless of the monitoring tool which you ultimately choose to deploy within your production system.

## 1 Configure the Target Endpoint

To specify the endpoint to which an InterSystems IRIS instance sends OTLP/HTTP signals, set the environment variable OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT on the instance’s host system to the desired address. For instructions on setting environment variables, refer to your operating system’s documentation. You can confirm that InterSystems IRIS can access the environment variable by invoking the GetEnviron() utility method from a Terminal session.

If you enable OTLP/HTTP emission and an OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT environment variable is not set, the
instance emits signals to the default endpoint for the OpenTelemetry Collector’s OTLP/HTTP receiver:
http://localhost:4318.

Emit Metrics

## 2 Emit Metrics

InterSystems IRIS can emit all of the metric events that the /api/monitor API collects (including your custom application metrics) to the OTLP/HTTP endpoint that you designate, at regular intervals.

To configure your instance to emit metric e vents:

1. Configure the instance to collect all of the metrics that you w ant to collect. If you want to collect interoperability pro-
duction metrics, you must manually enable them. You can also configure the instance to collect custom application metrics.

2. Configure your instance’ s OpenTelemetry exporter to start emitting metrics when the instance starts. You can do this

in any of the following ways:

- From the Management Portal: navigate to System Administration > Configuration > Additional Settings > Monitor, and select Enable OTel Metrics. Then, select Save.

- Change the OTELMetrics parameter by modifying the Config.Monitor class (as described in the class reference) or by editing the CPF file directly.

3.

If needed, modify the frequency at which the exporter will emit metrics. By default, the exporter emits signals every
## 10 seconds. You can change this interval in any of the following ways:

- From the Management Portal: navigate to System Administration > Configuration > Additional Settings > Monitor. Update the OTel Exporter Interval field with the length of the desired interv al, in seconds. Then, select Save.

- Change the OTELInterval parameter by modifying the Config.Monitor class (as described in the class reference) or by editing the CPF file directly.

4.

If you configured your instance in the preceding steps by modifying CPF parameters, restart the instance to allo w your changes to take effect.

## 3 Emit Logs

InterSystems IRIS can emit OTLP/HTTP signals for the same categories of log events which would be part of a structured log file—namely , events which are recorded to the system messages log (messages.log) or to the audit database. InterSystems IRIS emits structured log events to the OTLP/HTTP endpoint that you designate, at regular intervals.

To configure your instance to emit log e vents:

1. Configure your instance’ s OpenTelemetry exporter to start emitting log events when the instance starts. You can do

this in any of the following ways:

- From the Management Portal: navigate to System Administration > Configuration > Additional Settings > Monitor, and select Enable OTel Logs. Then, select Save.

- Change the OTELLogs parameter by modifying the Config.Monitor class (as described in the class reference) or by editing the CPF file directly.

2. As needed, configure the minimum se verity level that a log event must meet or exceed in order to be emitted by the
instance’s OpenTelemetry exporter. Severity levels are the same as those used in the structured log. The default severity level threshold is WARN. At this level, the exporter emits log events from the WARN, SEVERE, and FATAL
levels; it does not emit log events from the DEBUG2, DEBUG, and INFO levels.

You can change the minimum severity level in any of the following ways:

- From the Management Portal: navigate to System Administration > Configuration > Additional Settings > Monitor. Select the desired threshold severity level from the OTel Log Level drop-down menu. Then, select Save.

- Change the OTELLogLevel parameter by modifying the Config.Monitor class (as described in the class reference) or by editing the CPF file directly.

3.

If needed, modify the frequency at which the exporter will emit log events. By default, the exporter emits signals every
## 10 seconds.

You can change this interval in any of the following ways:

- From the Management Portal: navigate to System Administration > Configuration > Additional Settings > Monitor. Update the OTel Exporter Interval field with the length of the desired interv al, in seconds. Then, select Save.

- Change the OTELInterval parameter by modifying the Config.Monitor class (as described in the class reference) or by editing the CPF file directly.

4.

If you configured your instance in the preceding steps by modifying CPF parameters, restart the instance to allo w your changes to take effect.

## 4 Emit Traces

A trace records how a request moves through an application. It consists of one or more nestable spans, which represent the constituent units of work that the application performs as part of responding to the request. To record a trace, the application’s code must include instruments which generate spans, populate them with information, and contextualize them as part of a continuous trace. For more information about the OpenTelemetry specification for traces, refer to the OpenTelemetry documentation.

### 4.1 Optional: Enable Automatic Emission of Traces for Web Application Requests

InterSystems IRIS can automatically generate and emit traces for each request that a CSP, SOAP, or REST web application
sends. To enable automatic trace emission for a web application, perform the following steps:

1. Access the Management Portal for the InterSystems IRIS instance which hosts your web application.

2. Navigate to System Administration > Security > Applications > Web Applications. If necessary, select Go to access the

Web Applications page.

3. From the Web Application table, select the Name of the web application for which you wish to enable tracing.

4. The Enable section of the Edit Web Application page provides an Enable Traces checkbox for both REST and CSP/ZEN

applications. Select the Enable Traces checkbox which is appropriate to your web application.

5. Select Save.

Note:

The Enable Traces checkbox corresponds to the TraceEnabled property of the Security.Applications class. When necessary, you can enable or disable automatic tracing for a web application programmatically by modifying this property.

If you have created a TracerProvider object for the web application’s namespace at startup using SetTracerProvider() as described in the instrumentation instructions, InterSystems IRIS uses that TracerProvider to generate automatic web application traces. Otherwise, InterSystems IRIS uses a TracerProvider with default attributes.

For each request, the TracerProvider instantiates a Tracer object which is named after the web application. This Tracer emits a span which is named after the class that is dispatching the request (for CSP and SOAP requests) or the endpoint URL (for REST requests).

To populate an outbound request’s traceparent and tracestate headers with information about your application’s current active span, employ one of the injection methods that the %Trace.Propogation class provides, as described in the instrumentation instructions.

### 4.2 Instrument Your Application Code

Within InterSystems IRIS, the %Trace package provides a straightforward API for instrumenting your application code to produce traces in a way that conforms to the OTel specification. Once instruments within your application are producing traces, InterSystems IRIS emits them to the OTLP/HTTP endpoint that you designate.

In a supported IDE, edit your application code to produce traces using the %Trace API as follows:

1. Optional: if you want to sample a subset of your application’s traces, create an instance of a sampler class that extends

%Trace.AbstractSampler. You can implement your own sampling algorithm for your application by defining a custom ShouldSample() method. Refer to Implement a Custom Sampling Algorithm for further details.

To help you get started, the %Trace package provides the following sampler classes, which have the following effects:

- %Trace.AlwaysOffSampler — the application does not record or emit any spans.

- %Trace.AlwaysOnSampler — the application records and emits every span.

- %Trace.TraceIdRatioBasedSampler — the application records and emits a fix ed percentage of traces as specified by the sampler class’s Ratio property, which can assigned a decimal value between 0 and 1. To decide whether to sample a span, the sampler converts a hexadecimal interpretation of the rightmost characters of the span’s trace ID to a decimal number value and then compares that value against a threshold derived from the specified Ratio.

- %Trace.ParentBasedSampler — the application conditionally applies logic from different sampler classes to

determine whether a span should be recorded and emitted, depending upon the following conditions:

– whether the span is the root span of a trace or a child span.

– whether the span’s parent was initialized locally or remotely.

– whether the span’s parent was sampled or not.

The following example creates an instance of the %Trace.TraceIdRatioBasedSampler which configures the application to record and emit 10% of the traces that it creates.

ObjectScript

set sampleratio = 0.1
set sampler = ##class(%Trace.TraceIdRatioBasedSampler).%New(sampleratio)

Python

sampleratio = 0.1 sampler = iris.cls('%Trace.TraceIdRatioBasedSampler')._New(sampleratio)

2. Create an instance of the %Trace.TracerProvider class to serve as your application’s Tracer Provider.

The constructor for this class accepts two optional arguments. The first ar gument—passed by reference—is an array of key-value pairs which is used to set the TracerProvider object’s ResourceAttributes property. You can use this array

to specify global attributes about your application. If you have defined a sampler object for your application, pro vide it to the constructor as its second argument. Any traces that the application generates using this TracerProvider will be sampled according to the algorithm described by the specified sampler object.

The following example instantiates a TracerProvider (tracerProv) with a resource array identifying the name and version number of the service that it is tracing. Any traces which tracerProv creates will be sampled according to the logic described by sampler.

ObjectScript

set attributes("service.name") = "test_service" set attributes("service.version") = "2.0"
set tracerProv = ##class(%Trace.TracerProvider).%New(.attributes, sampler)

Python

attributes = {}
attributes["service.name"] = "test_service" attributes["service.version"] = "2.0" attrArray = iris.arrayref(attributes) tracerProv = iris.cls('%Trace.TracerProvider')._New(.attrArray, sampler)

Note:

If you have not specified a sampler object when you create a TracerProvider, InterSystems IRIS records and emits every span that was created by Tracer objects which that TracerProvider generated. However, it does not set the TraceFlags or TraceState properties for a span’s context.

3.

In most situations, it is preferable to instantiate a single TracerProvider object at startup, for shared use by instrumentation code across the namespace throughout the entire life cycle of the application. To designate a TracerProvider object for use across a namespace, provide it to the SetTracerProvider() method of the %Trace.Provider class, as
follows:

ObjectScript

do ##class(%Trace.Provider).SetTracerProvider(tracerProv)

Python

iris.cls('%Trace.Provider').SetTracerProvider(tracerProv)

When you need to access the TracerProvider object within your instrumentation code (as described in later steps), use
the complementary GetTracerProvider() method to recall it:

ObjectScript

set tracerProv = ##class(%Trace.Provider).GetTracerProvider()

Python

tracerProv = iris.cls('%Trace.Provider').GetTracerProvider()

4. To instrument your application code, first use the TracerProvider object’s GetTracer() method to instantiate a Tracer.

(The Tracer object generates the actual spans of the trace.)

GetTracer() accepts two arguments, Name and Version. Use these arguments to uniquely identify the application or
application component that you are tracing and specify its version number. For example:

ObjectScript

set tracer = tracerProv.GetTracer("service.orderprocessor", "2.0.2")

Python

tracer = tracerProv.GetTracer("service.orderprocessor", "2.0.2")

5. Start a root span using the Tracer object’s StartSpan() method. In order, StartSpan() accepts the following arguments,

which are used to define the properties of the span:

a. Name — A string, used to set the span’s name field

b. Parent — (Optional.) A %Trace.Context object that identifies the span which you wish to specify as the parent

span for the new span. If you do not provide a Parent and you have not previously specified an acti ve span (as described in a later step), then the method initializes the span as a root span, with a unique Trace ID.

c.

Spankind — (Optional.) A string, identifying the span as belonging to one of the OpenTelemetry specification’ s recognized span kinds. If you do not provide a Spankind, the span is classified as Internal by default.

d. Attributes — (Optional.) An array of key-value pairs, passed by reference.

e.

StartTime — (Optional.) A timestamp recording the span’s start time, in $ZTIMESTAMP format. If not provided,
StartTime is set to the current time.

For example, code which initializes a root span for processing a retail transaction may resemble the following:

ObjectScript

set rootAttr("customer.id") = customer.ID set rootAttr("product.id") = product.ID set rootSpan = tracer.StartSpan("order", , "Server", .rootAttr)

Python

rootspan = {}
rootAttr("customer.id") = customer.ID rootAttr("product.id") = product.ID rootAttrArray = iris.arrayref(rootAttr) set rootSpan = tracer.StartSpan("order", , "Server", .rootAttrArray)

Note:

If you want your application to propagate trace context from a web request that it has received into a new span, use the HttpExtract() or CSPRequestExtract() method of the %Trace.Propagation class to enhance the context of the current active span with the context provided by an HTTP header string or the headers of a %CSP.Request object (respectively). You can then specify this context object as the parent of the new span when you invoke StartSpan(). The following example demonstrates this procedure using a hypothetical CSP
request, cspRequest:

ObjectScript

set currentContext = ##class(%Trace.Context).GetCurrentContext()
set requestParentContext = ##class(%Trace.Propagation).CSPRequestExtract(cspRequest,
currentContext) set restApiSpan = tracer.StartSpan("rest_function", requestParentContext, "Server")

Python

currentContext = iris.cls('%Trace.Context').GetCurrentContext() requestParentContext = iris.cls('%Trace.Propagation').CSPRequestExtract(cspRequest, currentContext) restApiSpan = tracer.StartSpan("rest_function", requestParentContext, "Server")

6. As needed, nest child spans hierarchically within this root span. For simple implementations, you can manually specify
the parent span for a new span by creating a %Trace.Context object which identifies the desired parent as the ActiveSpan, and then providing that Context object as the Parent argument of StartSpan().

However, attempting to manage context across lexical scopes using this manual approach would be impractical. For this reason, the %Trace API provides a dynamic scoping mechanism for managing context.

To manage the distributed context of your trace dynamically, perform the following steps:

a. Designate the parent span as the "active" span using the Tracer object’s SetActiveSpan() method, as follows:

ObjectScript

set rootScope = tracer.SetActiveSpan(rootSpan)

Python

rootScope = tracer.SetActiveSpan(rootSpan)

SetActiveSpan() returns an instance of the %Trace.Scope class. This Scope object acts as a record that the corresponding span is active.

b. Start a new span by invoking StartSpan() without specifying a Parent, as follows:

ObjectScript

set childSpan1 = tracer.StartSpan("order_payproc")

Python

childSpan1 = tracer.StartSpan("order_payproc")

As long as the active span’s Scope object remains in memory, StartSpan() initializes new spans as children of the active span by default when no other Parent is specified.

c. To nest spans further, invoke SetActiveSpan() on a child span to designate it as the new active span and generate

a new Scope object. The active span is identified by the ne west Scope object which exists in memory at a given time. Therefore, once you have generated a Scope object for a new active span, StartSpan() will initialize new spans as its children by default.

Continuing the previous example, the following code starts a new span childSpan2 as a child of childSpan1 (which
is itself a child of rootSpan):

ObjectScript

set child1Scope = tracer.SetActiveSpan(childSpan1) set childSpan2 = tracer.StartSpan("order_payproc_addnewcard")

Python

child1Scope = tracer.SetActiveSpan(childSpan1) childSpan2 = tracer.StartSpan("order_payproc_addnewcard")

d. When you destroy the Scope object for the current active span, the span which was previously active becomes the default parent for StartSpan() once again (assuming you have not destroyed its Scope object as well). Continuing the previous examples, the following code starts a new span childSpan3 as a child of rootSpan and a sibling of
childSpan1:

ObjectScript

kill child1Scope set childSpan3 = tracer.StartSpan("order_sendconfirm", , "Server")

Python

iris.execute('kill child1Scope) childSpan3 = tracer.StartSpan("order_sendconfirm", , "Server")

7. As needed, define information about your spans. Available methods for this purpose include the following:

- Use the Span object’s AddEvent() method to add a span event.

- Use the Span object’s AddLink() method to add a span link.

- Modify the TraceFlags and TraceState properties of the Span object’s Context property (an instance of %Trace.SpanContext) to modify a span’s trace flags and trace state, respecti vely.

Continuing the previous examples, the following code enhances the "order_payproc" span (childSpan1) with a "pay-
mentdeclined" event and a link to a hypothetical span named paymentProcLivenessSpan:

ObjectScript

set eventAttr("declined.reason")="Unknown error occurred." do childSpan1.AddEvent("paymentdeclined", .eventAttr) do childSpan1.AddLink(paymentProcLivenessSpan.Context)

Python

eventAttr = {}
eventAttr("declined.reason") = "Unknown error occurred." eventAttrArray = iris.arrayref(eventAttr) childSpan1.AddEvent("paymentdeclined", .eventAttrArray) childSpan1.AddLink(paymentProcLivenessSpan.Context)

8.

If you are sending an HTTP request from your application, invoke an injection method from the %Trace.Propogation class to propagate context into the request’s headers. If you are constructing the HTTP request as a %Net.HttpRequest object, use the HttpRequestInject() method to inject traceparent and tracestate headers into the request object automatically. For other use cases, the HttpInject() method accepts a string containing the headers for an HTTP request and appends the aforementioned trace context headers to it.

Assuming a hypothetical %Net.HttpRequest object (request), the following code would retrieve the %Trace.Context object for the current active span and inject traceparent and tracestate headers into request based on that context object. It would then dispatch the enhanced request object as an HTTP GET request.

ObjectScript

set currentcontext = ##class(%Trace.Context).GetCurrentContext()
do ##class(%Trace.Propagation).HttpRequestInject(request, currentcontext)
do request.Get("/payment/auth")

Python

currentcontext = iris.cls('%Trace.Context').GetCurrentContext() iris.cls('%Trace.Propagation').HttpRequestInject(request, currentcontext) request.Get("/payment/auth")

9. Before you end a span, update the span’s status using the Span object’s SetStatus() method, as in the following example:

ObjectScript

do childSpan1.SetStatus("Ok")

Python

childSpan1.SetStatus("Ok")

SetStatus() accepts one argument (a string) which can have three possible values corresponding to the three span statuses recognized by the OpenTelemetry specification.

10. End each span using the Span object’s End() method. End() accepts an optional argument: a timestamp, in

$TIMESTAMP format. If a timestamp is provided, End() records that time as the end time for the span. Otherwise,
End() sets the span’s end time to the current time, as in the following example:

ObjectScript

do childSpan1.End()

Python

childSpan1.End()

InterSystems IRIS invokes the OpenTelemetry SDK to export the span when you end it, assuming that the ‘sampled’ bit in the span Context property’s TraceFlags has been set appropriately.

11. If you are using SetActiveSpan() to manage nested spans across lexical scopes (as suggested in a preceding step),

destroy the Scope object for each active span after you end the span. Continuing the previous examples, the following
code would conclude the trace encompassed by rootSpan and prepare the application to record a new trace:

ObjectScript

do rootSpan.SetStatus("Ok") do rootSpan.End() kill rootScope

Python

rootSpan.SetStatus("Ok")
rootSpan.End() iris.execute('kill rootScope')

12. As needed, import and recompile the code you have edited to enable tracing for your application.

### 4.3 Implement a Custom Sampling Algorithm

As mentioned by the instrumentation instructions, you can sample a subset of your application’s spans according to a custom sampling algorithm by defining a custom sampler class.

In a supported IDE, create a new class within the namespace for your application. This class should extend %Trace.AbstractSampler, and it must override the superclass’s ShouldSample() method with code that evaluates a span’s context according to your desired logic. When you invoke the TracerProvider for your application with a sampler object specified, the StartSpan() method of any Tracer object which the TracerProvider generates will invoke the sampler’s ShouldSample() method to determine whether to sample the new span.

The ShouldSample() method should accept the following arguments:

- Context — a %Trace.SpanContext object which contains information about the new span’s parent.

- TraceId — the trace ID associated with the new span’s parent span.

- Name — the name you have specified for the ne w span.

- SpanKind — the new span’s span kind.

- Attributes — the optional array of key-value pairs which the StartSpan() method received. You must pass this argument to the method by reference.

Given this information, the ShouldSample() method must return an instance of %Trace.SamplingResult. The application
samples the new span based on the Decision property, which can have one of three values:

- "DROP" instructs the application to discard the span.

- "RECORD_ONLY" instructs the application to record the span, so that your application can still access the span object and its contents. However, InterSystems IRIS will not emit the span to the OTLP/HTTP endpoint when it ends.

- "RECORD_AND_SAMPLE" instructs the application to record the span and emit it to the OTLP/HTTP endpoint when it ends.

The %Trace.SamplingResult that your ShouldSpan() method returns should maintain or update the trace state for the span using the TraceState property. You can also use its Attributes property to add attributes to the Attributes array for the new span.

The %Trace package provides several sampler classes to assist you as you implement your desired sampling algorithm. The %Trace.ParentBasedSampler class is especially noteworthy: it allows you to define multiple custom sampler classes and apply them conditionally to evaluate spans depending upon whether they are root spans or child spans, where their parent spans were created, and whether their parent spans were sampled. The reference for the class describes the conditions which are available (these are mapped as properties within the class). The reference for the %OnNew() method describes the order in which you should supply these instances to the constructor when you create an instance of the %Trace.ParentBasedSampler within your application code. You would then specify this instance of the %Trace.ParentBasedSampler class as the sampler for your application’s TracerProvider.

### 4.4 Deactivate Tracing

To deactivate tracing for your application after you have instrumented it, perform the following steps:

1. Edit your code so that it initializes any Tracer Provider that your application uses as an instance of

%Trace.NoopTracerProvider (instead of %Trace.TracerProvider). Revisiting the example provided in the preceding instrumentation instructions, deactivation would require you to change the line of code which sets the tracerProv object
so that it reads as follows:

ObjectScript

set tracerProv = ##class(%Trace.NoopTracerProvider).%New(.attributes)

Python

tracerProv = iris.cls('%Trace.NoopTracerProvider')._New(.attrArray)

Assuming that tracerProv has been set as the Tracer Provider which serves the entire namespace, no further edits would be necessary.

2. As needed, import and recompile the code you have edited to deactivate tracing for your application.

## 5 Error Handling and Recovery

An InterSystems IRIS instance’s OpenTelemetry exporter maintains a log file which you can use to troubleshoot an y errors that you may encounter while you are configuring your instance to emit signals. The path to the log file within the instance’ s installation directory (<installDir>) is <installDir>/mgr/irisotel.log.

Additionally, if the OpenTelemetry-compatible tool which was receiving signals at the OTLP/HTTP endpoint becomes unavailable due to an unexpected system error, the instance’s OpenTelemetry exporter logs an error to the system messages log (messages.log). It then stops emitting signals from the instance.

The SYS.Monitor.OTel class provides methods to help you test whether communication at the OTLP/HTTP endpoint has been restored: TestLogs(), TestMetrics(), and TestTraces().

Once you have resolved the cause of the error and restored the OTLP/HTTP connection, you can resume the emission of
signals as follows:

1. Open a Terminal session on the instance and navigate to the %SYS namespace.

2. To resume the emission of metrics and logs, execute the following command:

Terminal

do ##class(SYS.Monitor.OTel).Start()

3. To resume the emission of traces, execute the following command:

do ##class(SYS.Monitor.OTel).EnableTraces()
