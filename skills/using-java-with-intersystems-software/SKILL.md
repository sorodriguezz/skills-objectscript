# Using Java with InterSystems Software

Java with InterSystems Overview

See the Table of Contents for a detailed listing of the subjects covered in this document.

InterSystems IRIS® provides a wide variety of robust Java connectivity options:

- Lightweight SDKs that provide database access via JDBC, Java objects, or InterSystems multidimensional storage.

- Gateways that give InterSystems IRIS server applications direct access to Java applications and external databases.

The InterSystems JDBC driver is at the core of all InterSystems IRIS Java solutions. It is a powerful Type 4 (pure Java) fully compliant implementation of JDBC, closely coupled to InterSystems IRIS for maximum speed and efficienc y.

### 2.1 Core Data Access SDKs

The InterSystems JDBC driver supports three lightweight Java SDKs that provide direct access to InterSystems IRIS databases via relational tables, objects, and multidimensional storage.

Important:

The Core Data Access SDKs and External Server gateways form an integrated suite of utilities that can all share the same underlying reentrant connection context. Your application can use any combination of desired features from any part of the suite.

JDBC driver for relational table access

The InterSystems JDBC driver (described in this book) provides SQL based access to relational tables. It supports
the following features:

- relational access – –

store and query tables via SQL

stored JDBC tables can be accessed as InterSystems IRIS objects

- JDBC driver optimized for InterSystems IRIS – –

fully implemented type 4 (pure Java) JDBC

extensions for unique InterSystems IRIS property settings

InterSystems Java Connectivity Options

–

–

high speed batch reads

automatic connection pooling

- support for third party Java framework – Hibernate support Detailed information is provided in later chapters of this book, and in the “JDBC Driver Support ” chapter of the Implementation Reference for Java Third Party Software.

XEP SDK for object access

The InterSystems XEP SDK is designed for extremely fast acquisition of data objects in real time, and can also
be used as a convenient general purpose ORM interface. It supports the following features:

- optimized for speed – –

–

ultra-high speed real-time data acquisition. It can acquire data many times faster than standard JDBC.

batch reads

fine control o ver data serialization

- object-based access – –

–

lightweight alternative to Hibernate

store and query objects (create/read/update/delete)

schema import and customization

– mapping for most standard datatypes

–

stored objects can also be accessed as JDBC tables

- full process control – –

control indexing and fetch level

control transactions and locking

See Persisting Java Objects with InterSystems XEP for details.

Native SDK for direct access to InterSystems IRIS resources

The InterSystems Native SDK for Java is a lightweight toolset that gives your Java applications access to resources
formerly available only through ObjectScript. It supports the following features:

- directly access and manipulate global arrays – –

–

create and delete nodes

iterate over nodes and create/read/update/delete values

control transactions and locking

- call server-side ObjectScript code:

–

–

call methods and access properties from any compiled class

call functions or procedures from any compiled .mac file

- Create Java server applications that give ObjectScript clients direct access to Java objects via External Server gateways.

See Using the Native SDK for Java for details.

InterSystems External Servers

### 2.2 InterSystems External Servers

InterSystems External Servers provide an easy way access and manipulate both ObjectScript and Java objects in the same context, using the same connection. External server gateways are completely reentrant, allowing Java applications to manipulate ObjectScript objects, and ObjectScript applications to manipulate Java objects, both using the same bidirectional connection and context (database, session and transaction).

ObjectScript applications can also use ODBC as an alternate connectivity option (providing access to .NET objects and ADO) without any major changes in your ObjectScript code.

You must install the Java Runtime Environment to use the Java External Language Server. See Using InterSystems External Servers for detailed information.

### 2.3 InterSystems SQL Gateway

The InterSystems SQL Gateway connects InterSystems IRIS to external databases via JDBC. Various wizards can be used to create links to tables, views, or stored procedures in external sources. This allows you to read and store data in the external database just as you would on InterSystems IRIS, using objects and/or SQL queries. You even can generate class methods that perform the same actions as corresponding external stored procedures.

SQL Gateway applications are written in ObjectScript and run on the server. They can also use ODBC as an alternate connectivity option (providing access to .NET objects and ADO) without any major changes in your ObjectScript code.

You must install the Java Runtime Environment to use the JDBC SQL Gateway. See Using the SQL Gateway for detailed information on both JDBC and ODBC options.

### 2.4 Third Party Framework Support

Java frameworks such as Hibernate use JDBC to interact with databases, and include interfaces that can be implemented to take advantage of features unique to a specific database. InterSystems IRIS pro vides an implementation of the Hibernate Dialect interface.

Hibernate Dialect

The InterSystems Hibernate Dialect is a fully compliant implementation of the Hibernate dialect interface, providing a customized interface between Hibernate and InterSystems IRIS. Like most major dialect implementations, it is included as part of the Hibernate distribution.

See the “Hibernate Support” chapter in the Implementation Reference for Java Third Party Software for details.

This chapter discusses how to establish a JDBC connection between your application and InterSystems IRIS, and how to use the JDBC driver’s extension methods and properties.

- Establishing JDBC Connections — describes how to establish and control connections using DriverManager or
DataSource.

- Using Column-wise Binding for Bulk Inserts — describes extension methods that make batch inserts faster and easier to use.

- Connection Pooling — describes options for connection pooling and monitoring.

- Optimization and Testing Options — provides information on logging, shared memory, and statement pooling.

Connecting Your Application to InterSystems IRIS also provides instructions, including sample code, for connecting to an InterSystems IRIS server from a Java application using JDBC.

### 3.1 Establishing JDBC Connections

This section describes how to establish and control connections using DriverManager or DataSource.

- Defining a JDBC Connection URL — describes how to specify the parameters that define a JDBC connection.

- Using IRISDataSource to Connect — describes using IRISDataSource to load the driver and create a java.sql.Connection object.

- Using DriverManager to Connect — describes using the DriverManager class to create a connection.

#### 3.1.1 Defining a JDBC Connection URL

A java.sql.Connection URL supplies the connection with information about the host address, port number, and namespace to be accessed. The InterSystems JDBC driver also allows you to use several optional URL parameters.

##### 3.1.1.1 Required URL Parameters

The minimal required URL syntax is:

jdbc:IRIS://<host>:<port>/<namespace>

where the required parameters are defined as follo ws:

- host — IP address or Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN). F or example, both 127.0.0.1 and localhost indicate the local machine.

- port — TCP port number on which the InterSystems IRIS SuperServer is listening. The default is 1972. For more information, see DefaultPort in the Configur ation Parameter File Reference).

- namespace — InterSystems IRIS namespace to be accessed.

For example, the following URL specifies host as 127.0.0.1, port as 1972, and namespace as User:

jdbc:IRIS://127.0.0.1:1972/User

##### 3.1.1.2 Optional URL Parameters

In addition to host, port, and namespace, you can also specify several optional URL parameters. The full syntax is:

jdbc:IRIS://<host>:<port>/<namespace>/<logfile>:<eventclass>:<nodelay>:<ssl>

where the optional parameters are defined as follo ws:

- logfile — specifies a JDBC log file (see

- “ JDBC Logging”).

- eventclass — sets the transaction Event Class for this IRISDataSource object.

- nodelay — sets the TCP_NODELAY option if connecting via an IRISDataSource object. Toggling this flag can af fect the performance of the application. Valid values are true and false. If not set, it defaults to true.

ssl — enables TLS for both IRISDriver and IRISDataSource (see “Configuring TLS” in the Security Administration Guide). Valid values are true and false. If not set, it defaults to false.

Each of these optional URL parameters can be defined indi vidually, without specifying the others. For example, the following
URL sets only the required parameters and the nodelay option:

jdbc:IRIS://127.0.0.1:1972/User/::false

Other connection properties can be specified by passing them to DriverManager in a Properties object (see “Using Driver- Manager to Connect”).

#### 3.1.2 Using IRISDataSource to Connect

Use com.intersystems.jdbc.IRISDataSource to load the driver and then create the java.sql.Connection object. This is the preferred method for connecting to a database and is fully supported by InterSystems IRIS.

Opening a connection with IRISDataSource

The following example loads the driver, and then uses IRISDataSource to create the connection and specify username
and password:

try{
IRISDataSource ds = new IRISDataSource();
ds.setServerName("127.0.0.1");
ds.setPortNumber(51776);
ds.setDatabaseName("USER");
ds.setUser("_SYSTEM");
ds.setPassword("SYS");
IRISConnection connection = (IRISConnection) ds.getConnection();
}
catch (SQLException e){
System.out.println(e.getMessage());
}
catch (ClassNotFoundException e){
System.out.println(e.getMessage());
}

Establishing JDBC Connections

This example deliberately uses the literal address, 127.0.0.1, rather than localhost. On any system where the hostname resolves the same for IPv4 and IPv6, Java may attempt to connect via IPv6 if you use localhost.

Connecting with OAuth 2.0

You can authenticate with OAuth 2.0 by specifying an access token with IRISDataSource.setAccessToken. If
you provide an access token, the username and password and are ignored:

try{
IRISDataSource ds = new IRISDataSource();
ds.setServerName("127.0.0.1");
ds.setPortNumber(51776);
ds.setAccessToken(token);
IRISConnection connection = (IRISConnection) ds.getConnection();
}
catch (SQLException e){
System.out.println(e.getMessage());
}
catch (ClassNotFoundException e){
System.out.println(e.getMessage());
}

Note:

The IRISDataSource class provides an extended set of connection property accessors (such as setUser() and setPassword() in this example). See “Class IRISDataSource” in the Quick Reference for a complete list of accessors, and see “Connection Parameter Options” later in this reference for more information on all connection properties

#### 3.1.3 Using DriverManager to Connect

Although InterSystems recommends using IRISDataSource to connect, the DriverManager class can also be used to create
a connection. The following code demonstrates one possible way to do so, authenticating with a username and password:

String url="jdbc:IRIS://127.0.0.1:1972/User";
String username = "_SYSTEM";
String password = "SYS";
dbconnection = DriverManager.getConnection(url,username,password);

You can also specify connection properties for DriverManager in a Properties object, as demonstrated in the following code:

String url="jdbc:IRIS://127.0.0.1:1972/User";
java.sql.Driver drv = java.sql.DriverManager.getDriver(url);

java.util.Properties props = new Properties();
props.put("user",username);
props.put("password",password);
java.sql.Connection dbconnection = drv.connect(url, props);

You can also authenticate with OAuth:

String url="jdbc:IRIS://127.0.0.1:1972/User";
java.sql.Driver drv = java.sql.DriverManager.getDriver(url);

java.util.Properties props = new Properties();
props.put("AccessToken",token);
java.sql.Connection dbconnection = drv.connect(url, props);

See “Connection Parameter Options” later in this reference for a detailed list of available properties.

### 3.2 Using Column-wise Binding for Bulk Inserts

In JDBC, bulk inserts of prepopulated data are typically done by calling addBatch() in a loop, which is not optimal if the data is already in an array and ready to be sent to the server. InterSystems IRIS offers an extension that allows you to bypass the loop and pass in an entire array with one setObject() call.

For example, typical code calls setObject() for each item like this:

// Typical AddBatch() loop
for (int i=0;i<10000;i++){
statement.setObject(1,objOne);
statement.setObject(2,objTwo);
statement.setObject(3,objThree);
statement.addBatch();
}
statement.executeBatch();

Your code becomes faster and simpler when all items are loaded into an Object array and the entire array is added with one
call:

// Adding an ArrayList named objArray with a single call
IRISPreparedStatement.setObject(objArray);
statement.addBatch();
statement.executeBatch();

Columnwise binding assumes that the first parameter that is bound as an arraylist, will use the arraylist size (if more than one) to represents the number of rows in the batch. The other parameters bound as arraylists must be the same size or only have one value specified (ie. a user defined def "Unmatched columnwise parameter values: #rows rows expected, but found only #count in
# parameter!"

ault value) or we will throw an exception when addbatch() is called:

For example: given 3 parameters and 10 rows to be bound, you can bind 10 values to the arraylist in parameter 1, and parameters 2 and 3 must also have 10 values in their arraylists or only one value (if specifying a default value for all rows). It is expected to fill in all or one, an ything else will trigger an exception.

Here is an example that demonstrates the same operation with row-wise and column-wise binding:

bindRowWise()

public static void bindRowWise() throws Exception {

int rowCount = cName.size();
String insert = "INSERT INTO CUSTOMER VALUES(?,?,?,?)";
try {
PreparedStatement ps = conn.prepareStatement(insert);
for (int i=0;i<rowCount;i++){
ps.setObject(1,cName.get(i));
ps.setObject(2,cAddress.get(i));
ps.setObject(3,cPhone.get(i));
ps.setObject(4,cAcctBal.get(i));
ps.addBatch();
}
ps.executeBatch();
}
catch (Exception e) {
System.out.println("\nException in RowBinding()\n"+e);
}

} // end bindRowWise()

Connection Pooling

bindColumnWise()

public static void bindColumnWise() throws Exception {

String insert = "INSERT INTO CUSTOMER VALUES(?,?,?,?)";
try {
PreparedStatement ps = conn.prepareStatement(insert);
ps.setObject(1, new ArrayList<>(cName) );
ps.setObject(2, new ArrayList<>(cAddress) );
ps.setObject(3, new ArrayList<>(cPhone) );
ps.setObject(4, new ArrayList<>(cAcctBal) );
ps.addBatch();
ps.executeBatch();
catch (Exception e) {
System.out.println("\nException in bindColumnWise()\n"+e);
}

} // end bindColumnWise()

### 3.3 Connection Pooling

#### 3.3.1 Using IRISConnectionPoolDataSource Methods

The IRISConnectionPoolDataSource class implements ConnectionPoolDataSource and extends it with a set of proprietary
extensions that can be useful for testing and monitoring pooled connections. The following extensions are available:

- getConnectionWaitTimeout() returns the number of seconds that a Connection Pool Manager will wait for any connections to become available.

- getMaxPoolSize() returns the maximum number of connections allowed.

- getPoolCount() returns the current number of entries in the connection pool.

- restartConnectionPool() closes all physical connections and empties the connection pool.

- setMaxPoolSize() takes an int value that specifies the maximum number of connections to allo w in the pool. Defaults to 40.

- setConnectionWaitTimeout() takes an int value that specifies the connection w ait timeout interval in seconds. If no connections are available after the timout period expires, an exception is thrown. Defaults to 0, indicating that the connection will either be immediately made available, or an exception will be thrown indicating that the pool is full.

The IRISConnectionPoolDataSource class also inherits the proprietary extensions implemented in IRISDataSource (see “Connection Parameter Options ” in the Quick Reference).

Here are the steps for using this class with InterSystems IRIS:

1.

Import the needed packages:

import com.intersystems.jdbc.*;
import java.sql.*;

2.

Instantiate an IRISConnectionPoolDataSource object. Use the reStart() method to close all of the physical connections and empty the pool. Use setURL() (inherited from IRISDataSource) to set the database URL (see Defining a JDBC Connection URL) for the pool's connections.

IRISConnectionPoolDataSource pds = new IRISConnectionPoolDataSource();
pds.restartConnectionPool();
pds.setURL("jdbc:IRIS://127.0.0.1:1972/User");
pds.setUser("_system");
pds.setPassword("SYS");

3.

Initially, getPoolCount() returns 0.

System.out.println(pds.getPoolCount()); //outputs 0.

4. Use getConnection() to retrieve a database connection from the pool.

Connection dbConnection = pds.getConnection();

CAUTION:

InterSystems JDBC driver connections must always be obtained by calling the getConnection() method of IRISDataSource, which is enhanced to provide automatic, transparent connection pooling. The ConnectionPoolDataSource.getPooledConnection() methods are implemented because they are required by the JDBC standard, but they should never be called directly.

5. Close the connection. Now getPoolCount() returns 1.

dbConnection.close();
System.out.println(pds.getPoolCount()); //outputs 1

### 3.4 Optimization and Testing Options

This section contains specialized information that may be useful during development and testing.

- JDBC Logging — describes how to enable logging when testing JDBC applications.

- Shared Memory Connections — describes how a connection works when the server and client are on the same machine.

- Statement Pooling — describes how to store optimized statements in a cache the first time the y are used.

#### 3.4.1 JDBC Logging

If your applications encounter any problems, you can monitor by enabling logging. Run your application, ensuring that you trigger the error condition, then check all the logs for error messages or any other unusual activity. The cause of the error is often obvious.

Note:

Enable logging only when you need to perform troubleshooting. You should not enable logging during normal operation, because it will dramatically slow down performance.

To enable logging for JDBC when connecting to InterSystems IRIS, add a log file name to the end of your JDBC connection string. When you connect, the driver will save a log file that will be sa ved to the working directory of the application.

For example, suppose your original connection string is as follows:

jdbc:IRIS://127.0.0.1:1972/USER

To enable logging, change this to the following and then reconnect:

jdbc:IRIS://127.0.0.1:1972/USER/myjdbc.log

This log records the interaction from the perspective of the InterSystems IRIS database.

xists, new log entries will be appended to it by default. To delete the existing file and create If the specified log file already e a new one, prefix the log file name with a plus character ( + ). For example, the following string would delete myjdbc.log
(if it exists) and create a new log file with the same name:

jdbc:IRIS://127.0.0.1:1972/USER/+myjdbc.log

Optimization and Testing Options

#### 3.4.2 Shared Memory Connections

InterSystems IRIS uses a shared memory connection rather than TCP/IP when a Java application is running on the same machine as an InterSystems IRIS server instance. This section explains how shared memory works, and how to disable it for development and testing purposes.

Shared memory connections maximize performance by avoiding potentially expensive calls into the kernel network stack, thus providing optimal low latency and high throughput for JDBC operations.

If a connection specifies serv er address localhost or 127.0.0.1, shared memory will be used by default. TCP/IP will be used if the actual machine address is specified. The connection will automatically fall back to TCP/IP if the shared memory device fails or is not available.

Shared memory can be disabled in the connection string by setting the SharedMemory property to false. The following
example creates a connection that will not use shared memory even though the server address is specified as 127.0.0.1:

Properties props = new Properties();
props.setProperty("SharedMemory", "false");
props.setProperty("user", "_system");
props.setProperty("password", "SYS");
IRISConnection conn = (IRISConnection)DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:IRIS://127.0.0.1:1972/USER/
",props);

Accessors DataSource.getSharedMemory() and DataSource.setSharedMemory() can be used to read and set the current connection mode. The IRISConnection.isUsingSharedMemory() method can also be used to test the connection mode.

Shared memory is not used for TLS or Kerberos connections. The JDBC log will include information on whether a shared memory connection was attempted and if it was successful (see “JDBC Logging”).

Note:

Shared memory connections do not work across container boundaries

InterSystems does not currently support shared memory connections between two different containers. If a client tries to connect across container boundaries using localhost or 127.0.0.1, the connection mode will default to shared memory, causing it to fail. This applies regardless of whether the Docker --network host option is specified. You can guarantee a TCP/IP connection between containers either by specifying the actual hostname for the server address, or by disabling shared memory in the connection string (as demonstrated above).

Shared memory connections can be used without problems when the server and client are in the same container.

#### 3.4.3 Statement Pooling

JDBC 4.0 adds an additional infrastructure, statement pooling, which stores optimized statements in a cache the first time they are used. Statement pools are maintained by connection pools, allowing pooled statements to be shared between connections. All the implementation details are completely transparent to the user, and it is up to the driver to provide the required functionality.

InterSystems JDBC implemented statement pooling long before the concept became part of the JDBC specification. While the InterSystems IRIS driver uses techniques similar to those recommended by the specification, the actual pooling implementation is highly optimized. Unlike most implementations, InterSystems JDBC has three different statement pooling caches. One roughly corresponds to statement pooling as defined by the JDBC specification, while the other tw o are InterSystems IRIS specific optimizations. As required, InterSystems JDBC statement pooling is completely transparent to the user.

The InterSystems JDBC implementation supports Statement methods setPoolable() and isPoolable() as hints to whether the statement in question should be pooled. InterSystems IRIS uses its own heuristics to determine appropriate sizes for all three of its statement pools, and therefore does not support limiting the size of a statement pool by setting the maxStatements property in IRISConnectionPoolDataSource. The optional javax.sql.StatementEventListener interface is unsupported (and irrelevant) for the same reason.

Configuration and Requirements

To use the InterSystems JDBC driver, you should be familiar with the Java programming language and have some understanding of how Java is configured on your operating system. If you are performing custom configuration of the InterSystems JDBC driver on UNIX®, you should also be familiar with compiling and linking code, writing shell scripts, and other such tasks.

### 4.1 The InterSystems Java Class Packages

The main InterSystems Java class packages are contained in the following files (where <version> is a three-part package
version number such as 3.3.0):

- intersystems-jdbc-<version>.jar — the core JDBC jar file. All of the other files in this list are dependent on this file.

- In addition to the core JDBC API, this file also includes the classes that implement the Nati ve SDK (see Using the Native SDK for Java).

- intersystems-xep-<version>.jar — required for XEP Java persistence applications (see Persisting Java Objects with InterSystems XEP). Depends on the JDBC jar.

intersystems-uima-<version>.jar — required for UIMA support (see Using InterSystems UIMA). Depends on the JDBC jar.

There are separate versions of these files for each supported v ersion of Java, located in subdirectories of <install-dir>/dev/java/lib (for example, <install-dir>/dev/java/lib/JDK18 contains the files for Ja va 1.8).

You can determine the location of <install-dir> (the InterSystems IRIS root directory) for an instance of InterSystems IRIS
by opening the InterSystems terminal in that instance and issuing the following ObjectScript command:

write $system.Util.InstallDirectory()

You can also download the latest versions of the JDBC and XEP class packages from the InterSystems IRIS Driver Packages page.

Configuration and Requirements

### 4.2 Client-Server Configuration

The Java client and InterSystems IRIS server may reside on the same physical machine or they may be located on different
machines. Only the InterSystems IRIS server machine requires a copy of InterSystems IRIS; client applications do not
require a local copy.

#### 4.2.1 Java Client Requirements

The InterSystems IRIS Java client requires a supported version of the Java JDK. Client applications do not require a local copy of InterSystems IRIS.

The InterSystems Supported Platforms document for this release specifies the current requirements for all Ja va-based client applications. See the section on “Supported Java Technologies” for supported Java releases.

The core component of the Java binding is a file named provide the connection and caching mechanisms for communication with the InterSystems IRIS server and JDBC connectivity. Client applications do not require a local copy of InterSystems IRIS, but the intersystems-jdbc-3.2.0.jar file must be on the class path of the application when compiling or using Java proxy classes. See “The InterSystems IRIS Java Class Packages” for more information on these files.

intersystems-jdbc-3.2.0.jar, which contains the Java classes that

#### 4.2.2 InterSystems IRIS Server Configuration

Every Java client that wishes to connect to an InterSystems IRIS server needs a URL that provides the server IP address, TCP port number, and InterSystems IRIS namespace, plus a username and password.

To run a Java or JDBC client application, make sure that your installation meets the following requirements:

- The client must be able to access a machine that is currently running a compatible version of the InterSystems IRIS server (see the InterSystems Supported Platforms document for this release). The client and the server can be running on the same machine.

- Your class path must include the version of intersystems-jdbc-3.n.n.jar that corresponds to the client version of the Java JDK (see “The InterSystems IRIS Java Class Packages”).

- To connect to the InterSystems IRIS server, the client application must have the following information:

–

–

The IP address of the machine on which the InterSystems IRIS Superserver is running. The Java sample programs use the address of the server on the local machine (localhost or 127.0.0.1). If you want a sample program to connect to a different system you will need to change its connection string and recompile it.

The TCP port number on which the InterSystems IRIS Superserver is listening. The Java sample programs use the default port (see “DefaultPort” in the Configur ation Parameter File Reference). If you want a sample program to use a different port you will need to change its connection string and recompile it.

– A valid SQL username and password. You can manage SQL usernames and passwords on the System Administration > Security > Users page of the Management Portal. The Java sample programs use the administrator username, "_SYSTEM" and the default password "SYS" or "sys". Typically, you will change the default password after installing the server. If you want a sample program to use a different username and password you will need to change it and recompile it.

–

The server namespace containing the classes and data that your client application will use.

See “Establishing JDBC Connections ” for detailed information on connecting to the InterSystems IRIS server.

#### 4.2.3 Enabling the Transact SQL Dialect

By default, JDBC uses the InterSystems IRIS SQL dialect. You can change the dialect to support Transact SQL (TSQL)
dialects:

Client-Server Configuration

connection.setSQLDialect(int);

or

statement.setSQLDialect(int);

The available int options are 0 = InterSystems IRIS SQL (the default); 1 = MSSQL; 2 = Sybase.

You can also define the dialect in the dri ver properties.

When dialect > 0, the SQL statements prepared and or executed via JDBC are handled slightly differently on the server. The statements are processed using the dialect specified, and then con verted to InterSystems IRIS SQL and/or ObjectScript statements.

JDBC needs no introduction for experienced Java database developers, but it can be very useful even if you only use Java for occasional small utility applications. This section provides examples of some frequently used JDBC classes and methods for querying databases and working with the results.

- A Simple JDBC Application is a complete but very simple application that demonstrates the basic features of JDBC.

- The following sections demonstrate how to use PreparedStatement and CallableStatement to query databases and return
a ResultSet:

–

–

Executing a Prepared Statement — an example using implicit join syntax.

Executing Stored Procedures with CallableStatement — an example that executes a stored procedure.

– Returning Multiple Result Sets — accessing multiple result sets returned by InterSystems IRIS stored procedures.

- The following sections demonstrate using JDBC result sets to insert and update data in a database:

–

–

Inserting Data and Retrieving Generated Keys — using PreparedStatement and the SQL INSERT command.

Scrolling a Result Set — randomly accessing any row of a result set.

– Using Transactions — using the JDBC transaction model to commit or roll back changes.

Note:

In most cases, the examples in this section will be presented as fragments of code, rather than whole applications. These examples demonstrate some basic features as briefly and clearly as possible, and are not intended to teach good coding practices. The examples assume that a connection object named dbconnection has already been opened, and that all code fragments are within an appropriate try/catch statement.

### 5.1 A Simple JDBC Application

This section describes a very simple JDBC application that demonstrates the use of some of the most common JDBC
classes:

- A IRISDataSource object is used to create a Connection object that links the JDBC application to the InterSystems IRIS database.

- The Connection object is used to create a PreparedStatement object that can execute a dynamic SQL query.

- The PreparedStatement query returns a ResultSet object that contains the requested rows.

- The ResultSet object has methods that can be used to move to a specific ro w and read or update specified columns in the row.

All of these classes are discussed in more detail in the following sections.

The SimpleJDBC Application

To begin, import the JDBC packages and open a try block:

import java.sql.*;
import javax.sql.*;
import com.intersystems.jdbc.*;

public class SimpleJDBC{
public static void main() {
try {

// Use IRISDataSource to open a connection
Class.forName ("com.intersystems.jdbc.IRISDriver").newInstance();
IRISDataSource ds = new IRISDataSource();
ds.setURL("jdbc:IRIS://127.0.0.1:1972/User");
Connection dbconn = ds.getConnection("_SYSTEM","SYS");

// Execute a query and get a scrollable, updatable result set.
String sql="Select Name from Demo.Person Order By Name";
int scroll=ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE;
int update=ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE;
PreparedStatement pstmt = dbconn.prepareStatement(sql,scroll,update);
java.sql.ResultSet rs = pstmt.executeQuery();

// Move to the first row of the result set and change the name.
rs.first();
System.out.println("\n Old name = " + rs.getString("Name"));
rs.updateString("Name", "Bill. Buffalo");
rs.updateRow();
System.out.println("\n New name = " + rs.getString("Name") + "\n");

// Close objects and catch any exceptions.
pstmt.close();
rs.close();
dbconn.close();
} catch (Exception ex) {
System.out.println("SimpleJDBC caught exception: "
+ ex.getClass().getName() + ": " + ex.getMessage());
}
} // end main()
} // end class SimpleJDBC

### 5.2 Query Using a Prepared Statement

The following query uses a prepared statement to return a list of all employees with names beginning in “ A” through “E”
who work for a company with a name starting in “M” through “Z”:

Select ID, Name, Company->Name from Demo.Employee Where Name < ? and Company->Name > ? Order By Company->Name

Note:

This statement uses Implicit Join syntax (the –> operator), which provides a simple way to access the Company class referenced by Demo.Employee.

To implement the prepared statement:

- Create the string containing the query and use it to initialize the PreparedStatement object, then set the values of the
query parameters and execute the query:

Query Using Stored Procedures with CallableStatement

String sql= "Select ID, Name, Company->Name from Demo.Employee " + "Where Name < ? and Company->Name > ? " +
"Order By Company->Name";
PreparedStatement pstmt = dbconnection.prepareStatement(sql);

pstmt.setString(1,"F");
pstmt.setString(2,"L");
java.sql.ResultSet rs = pstmt.executeQuery();

- Retrieve and display the result set:

java.sql.ResultSet rs = pstmt.executeQuery();
ResultSetMetaData rsmd = rs.getMetaData();
int colnum = rsmd.getColumnCount();
while (rs.next()) {
for (int i=1; i<=colnum; i++) {
System.out.print(rs.getString(i) + " ");
}
System.out.println();
}

### 5.3 Query Using Stored Procedures with CallableStatement

The following code executes ByName, an InterSystems IRIS stored procedure contained in Demo.Person:

- Create a java.sql.CallableStatement object and initialize it with the name of the stored procedure. The SqlName of the
procedure is SP_Demo_By_Name, which is how it must be referred to in the Java client code:

String sql="call Demo.SP_Demo_By_Name(?)"
CallableStatement cs = dbconnection.prepareCall(sql);

- Set the value of the query parameter and execute the query, then iterate through the result set and display the data:

cs.setString(1,"A");
java.sql.ResultSet rs = cs.executeQuery();

ResultSetMetaData rsmd = rs.getMetaData();
int colnum = rsmd.getColumnCount();
while (rs.next()) {
for (int i=1; i<=colnum; i++)
System.out.print(rs.getString(i) + " ");
}
System.out.println();

### 5.4 Query Returning Multiple Result Sets

InterSystems IRIS allows you to define a stored procedure that returns multiple result sets. The InterSystems JDBC driver supports the execution of such stored procedures. Here is an example of an InterSystems IRIS stored procedure that returns
two result sets (note that the two query results have different column structures):

/// This class method produces two result sets.
ClassMethod DRS(st) [ ReturnResultsets, SqlProc ]
{
$$$ResultSet("select Name from Demo.Person where Name %STARTSWITH :st")
$$$ResultSet("select Name, DOB from Demo.Person where Name %STARTSWITH :st")
Quit
}

$$$ResultSet is a predefined InterSystems macro that prepares a SQL statement (specified as a string literal), e
and returns the resultset.

xecutes it,

The following code executes the stored procedure and iterates through both of the returned result sets:

- Create the java.sql.CallableStatement object and initialize it using the name of the stored procedure. Set the query
parameters and use execute to execute the query:

- CallableStatement cs = dbconnection.prepareCall("call Demo.Person_DRS(?)");
cs.setString(1,"A");
boolean success=cs.execute();

Iterate through the pair of result sets displaying the data. After getResultSet retrieves the current result set, getMoreResults closes it and moves to the CallableStatement object's next result set.

if(success) do{
java.sql.ResultSet rs = cs.getResultSet();
ResultSetMetaData rsmd = rs.getMetaData();
for (int j=1; j<rsmd.getColumnCount() + 1; j++)
System.out.print(rsmd.getColumnName(j)+ "\t\t");
System.out.println();
int colnum = rsmd.getColumnCount();
while (rs.next()) {
for (int i=1; i<=colnum; i++)
System.out.print(rs.getString(i) + " \t ");
System.out.println();
}
System.out.println();
} while (cs.getMoreResults());

### 5.5 Inserting Data and Retrieving Generated Keys

The following code inserts a new row into Demo.Person and retrieves the generated ID key.

- Create the PreparedStatement object, initialize it with the SQL string, and specify that generated keys are to be returned:

String sqlIn="INSERT INTO Demo.Person (Name,SSN,DOB) " + "VALUES(?,?,?)";
int keys=Statement.RETURN_GENERATED_KEYS;
PreparedStatement pstmt = dbconnection.prepareStatement(sqlIn, keys);

Scrolling a Result Set

- Set the values for the query parameters and execute the update:

String SSN = Demo.util.generateSSN(); // generate a random SSN
java.sql.Date DOB = java.sql.Date.valueOf("1984-02-01");

pstmt.setString(1,"Smith,John"); // Name
pstmt.setString(2,SSN); // Social Security Number
pstmt.setDate(3,DOB); // Date of Birth
pstmt.executeUpdate();

- Each time you insert a new row, the system automatically generates an object ID for the row. The generated ID key is
retrieved into a result set and displayed along with the SSN:

java.sql.ResultSet rsKeys = pstmt.getGeneratedKeys();
rsKeys.next();
String newID=rsKeys.getString(1);
System.out.println("new ID for SSN " + SSN + " is " + newID);

Although this code assumes that the ID will be the first and only generated k ey in rsKeys, this is not always a safe assumption in real life.

- Retrieve the new row by ID and display it (Age is a calculated value based on DOB).

String sqlOut="SELECT IName,Age,SSN FROM Demo.Person WHERE ID="+newID;
pstmt = dbconnection.prepareStatement(sqlOut);
java.sql.ResultSet rsPerson = pstmt.executeQuery();

int colnum = rsPerson.getMetaData().getColumnCount();
rsPerson.next();
for (int i=1; i<=colnum; i++)
System.out.print(rsPerson.getString(i) + " ");
System.out.println();

### 5.6 Scrolling a Result Set

The InterSystems JDBC driver supports scrollable result sets, which allow your Java applications to move both forward and backward through the resultset data. The prepareStatement() method uses following parameters to determine how
the result set will function:

- The resultSetType parameter determines how changes are displayed:

–

–

ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE creates a scrollable result set that displays changes made to the underlying data by other processes.

ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE creates a scrollable result set that only displays changes made by the current process.

- The resultSetConcurrency parameter must be set to ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE if you intend to update the result set.

The following code creates and uses a scrollable result set:

- Create a PreparedStatement object, set the query parameters, and execute the query:

String sql="Select Name, SSN from Demo.Person "+
" Where Name > ? Order By Name";
int scroll=ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE;
int update=ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE;

PreparedStatement pstmt = dbconnection.prepareStatement(sql,scroll,update);
pstmt.setString(1,"S");
java.sql.ResultSet rs = pstmt.executeQuery();

A result set that is going to have new rows inserted should not include the InterSystems IRIS ID column. ID values are defined automatically by InterSystems IRIS.

- The application can scroll backwards as well as forwards through this result set. Use afterLast to move the result set's cursor to after the last row. Use previous to scroll backwards.

rs.afterLast();
int colnum = rs.getMetaData().getColumnCount();
while (rs.previous()) {
for (int i=1; i<=colnum; i++)
System.out.print(rs.getString(i) + " ");
System.out.println();
}

- Move to a specific ro w using absolute. This code displays the contents of the third row:

rs.absolute(3);
for (int i=1; i<=colnum; i++)
System.out.print(rs.getString(i) + " ");
System.out.println();

- Move to a specific ro w relative to the current row using relative. The following code moves to the first ro w, then

scrolls down two rows to display the third row again:

rs.first();
rs.relative(2);
for (int i=1; i<=colnum; i++)
System.out.print(rs.getString(i) + " ");
System.out.println();

- To update a row, move the cursor to that row and update the desired columns, then invoke updateRow:

rs.last();
rs.updateString("Name", "Avery. Tara R");
rs.updateRow();

- To insert a row, move the cursor to the “insert row” and then update that row's columns. Be sure that all non-nullable
columns are updated. Finally, invoke insertRow:

rs.moveToInsertRow();
rs.updateString(1, "Abelson,Alan");
rs.updateString(2, Demo.util.generateSSN()));
rs.insertRow();

### 5.7 Using Transactions

The InterSystems JDBC driver supports the standard JDBC transaction model.

- In order to group SQL statements into a transaction, you must first disable autocommit mode using setAutoCommit():

- dbconnection.setAutoCommit(false);

Use commit() to commit to the database all SQL statements executed since the last execution of commit() or rollback:

pstmt1.execute();
pstmt2.execute();
pstmt3.execute();
dbconnection.commit();

- Use rollback() to roll back all of the transactions in a transactions. Here the rollback() is invoked if SQLException is
thrown by any SQL statement in the transaction:

Using Transactions

catch(SQLException ex) {
if (dbconnection != null) {
try {
dbconnection.rollback();
} catch (SQLException excep){
// (handle exception)
}
}
}

Here is a brief summary of the java.sql.Connection methods used in this example:

- setAutoCommit() By default Connection objects are in autocommit mode. In this mode an SQL statement is committed as soon as it is executed. To group multiple SQL statements into a transaction, first use setAutoCommit(false) to take the Connection object out of autocommit mode. Use setAutoCommit(true) to reset the Connection object to autocommit mode.

- commit()

- Executing commit() commits all SQL statements executed since the last execution of either commit() or rollback(). Note that no exception will be thrown if you call commit() without first setting autocommit to false.

rollback()

Executing rollback aborts a transaction and restores any values changed by the transaction back to their original state.

Note:

The Native SDK for Java transaction model

The Native SDK for Java offers an alternative to the java.sql transaction model demonstrated here. The Native SDK transaction model is based on ObjectScript transaction methods, and is not interchangeable with the JDBC model. The Native SDK model must be used if your transactions include Native SDK method calls. See Using the Native SDK for Java for details.

This chapter is a quick reference for the following extended classes and options:

- Class ConnectionPoolDataSource — methods related to InterSystems connection pooling.

- Class IRISDataSource — InterSystems-specific connection properties.

- Connection Parameter Options — lists connection parameters that can be used in properties files.

Note:

This reference lists only the extension methods and variants discussed elsewhere in this document. See “JDBC Driver Support” in the Implementation Reference for Java Third Party APIs for a complete description of all InterSystems JDBC driver features, including extensions, variants, and implementation of optional JDBC features.

### 6.1 Class ConnectionPoolDataSource

The com.intersystems.jdbc.ConnectionPoolDataSource class fully implements the javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource interface, and also includes the following set of extension methods to control InterSystems IRIS connection pooling. For more information, see “Using IRISConnectionPoolDataSource Methods”.

getConnectionLifetime()

ConnectionPoolDataSource.getConnectionLifetime() returns the connection lifetime in seconds (also see setConnectionLifetime()).

int getConnectionLifetime()

getConnectionWaitTimeout()

ConnectionPoolDataSource.getConnectionWaitTimeout() returns the number of seconds that a Connection Pool Manager will wait for any connections to become available (also see setConnectionWaitTimeout()).

getPooledConnection()

Always use IRISDataSource.getConnection() instead of this method.

Do not call this method

ConnectionPoolDataSource.getPooledConnection() is required by the interface, but should never be invoked directly. The InterSystems JDBC driver controls connection pooling transparently.

InterSystems JDBC driver connections must always be obtained by calling the getConnection() method of IRISDataSource, which is enhanced to provide automatic, transparent connection pooling. The ConnectionPoolDataSource.getPooledConnection() methods are implemented because they are required by the JDBC standard, but they should never be called directly.

getValidateOnConnect()

ConnectionPoolDataSource.getValidateOnConnect() returns the PingOnConnect setting for the DataSource (also see setValidateOnConnect()).

boolean getValidateOnConnect()

restartConnectionPool()

ConnectionPoolDataSource.restartConnectionPool() restarts a connection pool. Closes all physical connections, and empties the connection pool. Throws SQLException.

setMaxPoolSize()

ConnectionPoolDataSource.setMaxPoolSize() sets a maximum connection pool size. If the maximum size is not set, it defaults to 40 (also see getMaxPoolSize()).

void setMaxPoolSize(int max)

- max — optional maximum connection pool size (default 40).

setMinPoolSize()

ConnectionPoolDataSource.setMinPoolSize() sets a minimum connection pool size (also see getMinPoolSize()). Defaults to 0.

void setMinPoolSize(int min)

- min — optional minimum connection pool size (default 0).

setConnectionWaitTimeout()

ConnectionPoolDataSource.setConnectionWaitTimeout() sets the connection wait timeout interval to the specified number of seconds (also see getConnectionWaitTimeout()). Defaults to 0.

- timeout — timeout interval in seconds (defaults to 0).

If no connections are available after the timout period expires, an exception is thrown. Defaults to 0, indicating that the connection will either be immediately made available, or an exception will be thrown indicating that the pool is full.

setConnectionLifetime()

ConnectionPoolDataSource.setConnectionLifetime() sets the connection lifetime value in seconds (also see getConnectionLifetime()). Default is 0 (no limit).

void setConnectionLifetime(int conLifeTime)

- conLifeTime — lifetime in seconds setValidateOnConnect() ConnectionPoolDataSource.setValidateOnConnect() sets the current PingOnConnect setting for the DataSource (also see getValidateOnConnect()). Default is true.

- p — new PingOnConnect setting

### 6.2 Class IRISDataSource

The com.intersystems.jdbc.IRISDataSource class fully implements the javax.sql.DataSource interface, and also includes numerous extension methods for getting or setting InterSystems IRIS connection properties (see “ Connection Parameter Options” for more information).

IRISDataSource does not inherit the methods of javax.sql.CommonDataSource, which is not supported by the InterSystems JDBC driver.

getConnection()

#### 6.3.1 Listing Connection Properties

Code similar to the following can be used to list the available properties for any compliant JDBC driver:

java.sql.Driver drv = java.sql.DriverManager.getDriver(url);
java.sql.Connection dbconnection = drv.connect(url, user, password);
java.sql.DatabaseMetaData meta = dbconnection.getMetaData();
System.out.println ("\n\n\nDriver Info: ==========================");
System.out.println (meta.getDriverName());
System.out.println ("release " + meta.getDriverVersion() + "\n");

java.util.Properties props = new Properties();
DriverPropertyInfo[] info = drv.getPropertyInfo(url,props);

for(int i = 0; i <info.length; i++) {
System.out.println ("\n" + info[i].name);
if (info[i].required) {System.out.print(" Required");}
else {System.out.print (" Optional");}
System.out.println (", default = " + info[i].value);
if (info[i].description != null)
System.out.println (" Description:" + info[i].description);
if (info[i].choices != null) {
System.out.println (" Valid values: ");
for(int j = 0; j < info[i].choices.length; j++)
System.out.println(" " + info[i].choices[j]);
}
}
