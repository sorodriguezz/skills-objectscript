# Adding SOAP Services and Web Clients to Productions

Productions

This page introduces how you can use web services within interoperability productions.

See Creating Web Services and Web Clients for information on the specific standards follo wed by InterSystems product support for SOAP and web services, including WSDL limitations.

### 1.1 InterSystems IRIS Support for Web Services

You can provide a SOAP-enabled front end for your production. To do so, you create an production web service, which is both a web service and a business service. Internally, your web methods generally receive SOAP request messages, use them to create and send request messages as needed within the production, receive the response messages, and use them to create SOAP response messages.

To enable you to create a production web service, InterSystems IRIS provides the base production web service class (EnsLib.SOAP.Service), as well as supporting classes in the %SOAP and %XML packages.

InterSystems IRIS provides powerful, built-in support for web services. The base production web service class does the
following for you:

- Validates incoming SOAP messages.

InsideProductionOutsideProdu...WebServiceotherparts...RequestResponseSOAPresp...SOAPrequ...

Introduction to Web Services in Productions

- Unpacks SOAP messages, converts data to InterSystems IRIS representation, and invokes the corresponding method, which sends a request message to a destination inside the production.

- Runs the method.

- Receives a response message and then creates and returns a response message (a SOAP message) to the caller.

The SOAP specification does not include session support. Ho wever, it is often useful to maintain a session between a web client and the web service that it uses. You can do this with a production web service. If a web service uses sessions, it establishes a session ID and allows repeated calls on the service after one successfully authenticated call from a client.

The production web service class also provides the full functionality of any business service.

### 1.2 InterSystems IRIS Support for Web Clients

You can invoke an external web service from within a production. To do so, you create an InterSystems IRIS web client.

At a high level, your InterSystems IRIS web client receives InterSystems IRIS requests, converts them to SOAP requests and sends them to the appropriate web service. Similarly, it receives SOAP responses and converts them into InterSystems IRIS responses.

The InterSystems IRIS web client consists of the following parts, all of which you can generate programmatically:

- A proxy client class that defines a proxy method for each method defined by the web service. The purpose of the proxy client is to specify the location of the web service and to contain the proxy methods. Each proxy method uses the same signature used by the corresponding web service method and invokes that method when requested.

- A business operation that uses the InterSystems IRIS SOAP outbound adapter to invoke the proxy methods.

- Supporting classes as needed to define XML types and production messages.

#### 1.2.1 The SOAP Wizard

In order to understand these parts, it is useful to consider how they are generated. First, when you use the SOAP wizard, you provide the URL for the WSDL of the web service of interest. The wizard reads the WSDL and then generates a set of classes.

InterSystems IRIS Support for Web Clients

#### 1.2.2 The Proxy Client

The generated classes include the proxy client class that defines a proxy method for each method of the web service. Each proxy method sends a SOAP request to the web service and receives the corresponding SOAP response.

As shown in the figure, the generated classes also include classes that define an the methods.

#### 1.2.3 The Business Operation of an InterSystems IRIS Web Client

InterSystems IRIS can also generate a business operation class that invokes the proxy client, as well as classes that define
message types as needed. The following figure sho ws how these classes work:

Introduction to Web Services in Productions

The classes and methods shown within dashed lines are all generated.

The business operation uses the SOAP outbound adapter, which provides useful runtime settings and the generic method InvokeMethod(). To invoke a proxy method in the proxy client class, the business operation class calls InvokeMethod(), passing to it the name of the method to run, as well as any arguments. In turn, InvokeMethod() calls the method of the proxy client class.

Creating a Web Service in a Production

This topic describes how to create an production web service, which is a web service in a production. When you do this, you are providing a SOAP-enabled interface to the production.

For settings not discussed here, see Settings in All Productions.

For an alternative approach, see Using the SOAP Inbound Adapter.

Tip:

InterSystems IRIS® also provides specialized business service classes that use SOAP, and one of those might be suitable for your needs. If so, no programming would be needed. See Connectivity Options.

### 2.1 Overall Behavior

A production web service is based on EnsLib.SOAP.Service or a subclass. This class extends both Ens.BusinessService (so that it is a business service) and %SOAP.WebService (so that it can act as a web service as well). A production web service
behaves as follows:

- Because it is a web service, it has a WSDL document (generated automatically) that describes the web methods available in it. The service can receive any SOAP message that conforms to the WSDL and sends SOAP responses in return.

- Because it is a business service, it is an integral part of the production to which you add it. Monitoring, error logging, runtime parameters, and all the rest of the production machinery are available as usual.

Note:

A production web service is not available unless the production is running (and the business service is enabled).

Communication with the outside world is done via SOAP request and response messages. InterSystems IRIS Interoperability request and response messages are used within the production.

### 2.2 Basic Requirements

To create a web service in a production, you create a new business service class as described here. Later, add it to your production and configure it

.

You must also create appropriate message classes, if none yet exist. See Defining Messages .

Creating a Web Service in a Production

In order to provide access to the web service, you also need to define a web application definition for the namespace in which the web service is running. The web application definition must be configured to use CSP/ZEN options instead of REST options. The option Inbound Web Services must be enabled.

The following list describes the basic requirements of the business service class:

- Your class should extend EnsLib.SOAP.Service. This class extends both Ens.BusinessService (so that it is a business service) and %SOAP.WebService (so that it can act as a web service as well).

- The class should define the ADAPTER parameter as null (""). For example:

Class Member

Parameter ADAPTER = "";

Or, equivalently:

Class Member

Parameter ADAPTER;

- The class should specify values for other parameters:

Parameter

Description

SERVICENAME

NAMESPACE

TYPENAMESPACE

Name of the web service.This name must start with a letter and must contain only alphanumeric characters. The default service name is
"MyProductionRequestWebService"

URI that defines the target XML namespace for your web service, so that your service, and its contents, do not conflict with another service. This is initially set to http://tempuri.org which is a temporary URI used by SOAP developers during development.

XML namespace for the schema in the types defined by the web service. If you do not specify this parameter, the schema is in the namespace given by NAMESPACE instead.

RESPONSENAMESPACE

URI that defines the XML namespace for the response messages. By default, this is equal to the namespace given by the NAMESPACE parameter.

- The class should define web methods, as described in Defining Web Methods.

- For other options and general information, see Defining a Business Service Class .

The following example shows in general what the class might look like:

Class Definition

Class Hospital.MyService Extends EnsLib.SOAP.Service
{

///For this business service, ADAPTER should be "" so that we use the normal SOAP processing
Parameter ADAPTER = "";

Parameter SERVICENAME = "MyService";

Parameter NAMESPACE = "http://www.myhospital.org";

Parameter USECLASSNAMESPACES = 1;

Method GetAuthorization(patientID As %Integer, RequestedOperation As %String,
LikelyOutcome As %String) As %Status [ WebMethod ]
{

Defining Web Methods for Use in InterSystems IRIS

set request = ##class(Hospital.OperateRequest).%New()
set request.PatientID = patientID set request.RequestedOperation = RequestedOperation set request.LikelyOutcome = LikelyOutcome set tSC=..SendRequestSync("Hospital.PermissionToOperateProcess",request,.response)
// Create the SOAP response, set its properties, and return it.
}

}

### 2.3 Defining Web Methods for Use in InterSystems IRIS

This section describes the basic requirements for an InterSystems IRIS web method.

- Define the method within a subclass of EnsLib.SOAP.Service, as described in Basic Requirements.

- Mark the method with the WebMethod keyword.

- Ensure that all arguments and return values are XML-enabled:

–

–

–

If the method uses an object as an argument or a return value, you must ensure that the object is XML-enabled. That is, the class definitions for the types must e xtend %XML.Adaptor. The default settings for this class are normally
suitable; if not, see Projecting Objects to XML.

If the method uses a data set as an argument or return value, you must ensure the data set is of type %XML.DataSet.

To use a collection (%ListOfObjects or %ArrayOfObjects) as an argument or a return value, you must ensure that the ELEMENTTYPE parameter of the collection is set and refers to an XML-enabled class.

Important:

In most cases, web methods should be instance methods. Within a web method, it is often necessary to set properties of and invoke methods of the web service instance to fine-tune the beha vior of the method. Because a class method cannot do these tasks, a class method is usually not suitable as a web method.

For additional notes, see Basic Requirements.

#### 2.3.1 Basic Steps of an InterSystems IRIS Interoperability Web Method

Within a production web service, a web method should generally do the following:

1. Create a request message and set its properties with information from the inbound SOAP message.

2. Call a suitable method of the business service to send the request to a destination within the production. Specifically ,
call SendRequestSync(), SendRequestAsync(), or (less common) SendDeferredResponse(). For details, see Sending
Request Messages.

Each of these methods returns a status (specifically , an instance of %Status).

3. Check the status returned from the previous step and react appropriately.

4. Then:

- In the case of success, look at the response message that is returned by reference and use it to create the return value of the web method. As noted previously, the return value must be XML-enabled so that it can be packaged as a SOAP response.

- In the case of failure, call the ReturnMethodStatusFault() or ReturnStatusFault() method of the web service
so that a SOAP fault can be returned and an Ens.Alert can be generated; see the next section for details.

Creating a Web Service in a Production

#### 2.3.2 Returning Faults to the Caller

By default, if an error occurs when a web method runs, the web service returns a SOAP message to the caller, but this
message does not indicate where precisely the fault occurred. An example follows:

<SOAP-ENV:Body>
<SOAP-ENV:Fault>
<faultcode>SOAP-ENV:Server</faultcode> <faultstring>Server Application Error</faultstring> <detail> <error xmlns='http://www.myapp.org' > <text>ERROR #5002: ObjectScript error: <INVALID OREF> zGetCustomerInfo+10^ESOAP.WebService.1</text> </error> </detail>
</SOAP-ENV:Fault>
</SOAP-ENV:Body>

Your web methods should check for an error and use ReturnMethodStatusFault() or ReturnStatusFault(). In case of
error, the message will be more informative, as follows:

<SOAP-ENV:Body>
<SOAP-ENV:Fault>
<faultcode>SOAP-ENV:Method</faultcode> <faultstring>Server Application Error</faultstring> <faultactor>ESOAP.WebService</faultactor> <detail> <error xmlns='http://www.myapp.org' >
<text>ERROR <Ens>ErrException:
<DIVIDE>zGetCustomerRequest+8^ESOAP.MyOperation.1 - logged as '13 Jul 2007' number 4 @' set x=100/0'</text> </error> </detail>
</SOAP-ENV:Fault>
</SOAP-ENV:Body>

The ReturnMethodStatusFault() and ReturnStatusFault() methods return a SOAP fault to the caller and then generate
an exception which will create an alert (depending on settings). These methods have the following signatures:

ClassMethod ReturnStatusFault(pCode As %String,
pStatus As %Status)

ClassMethod ReturnMethodStatusFault(pStatus As %Status)

Here:

- pCode is a string that represents the error code to use in the <faultcode> element of the SOAP fault. The ReturnMethodStatusFault() method uses the generic error code SOAP-ENV:Method

- pStatus is the status to use in the returned SOAP fault. This is used to create the details of the SOAP fault.

Also notice that these methods set the <faultactor> element of the SOAP fault.

#### 2.3.3 Example

The following shows a simple example:

Class Member

Method GetCustomerInfo(ID As %Numeric) As ESOAP.SOAPResponse [WebMethod]
{
//create request message with given ID
set request=##class(ESOAP.CustomerRequest).%New()
set request.CustomerID=ID

//send request message
set sc= ..SendRequestSync("GetCustomerInfoBO",request,.response)
if $$$ISERR(sc) do ..ReturnMethodStatusFault(sc)

Viewing the WSDL

//use info from InterSystems IRIS response to create SOAP response
set soapresponse=##class(ESOAP.SOAPResponse).%New()
set soapresponse.CustomerID=response.CustomerID set soapresponse.Name=response.Name set soapresponse.Street=response.Street set soapresponse.City=response.City set soapresponse.State=response.State set soapresponse.Zip=response.Zip

quit soapresponse
}

### 2.4 Viewing the WSDL

In InterSystems IRIS, a web service runs within an InterSystems IRIS web application. In turn, the web application is served by your choice of web server (the same web server that serves the Management Portal).

InterSystems IRIS automatically creates and publishes a WSDL document that describes your web service. Whenever you modify and recompile the web service, InterSystems IRIS automatically updates the WSDL correspondingly.

The URL has the following form, using the <baseURL> for your instance:

https:<baseURL>/csp/app/web_serv.cls?WSDL

Here /csp/app is the name of the web application in which the web service resides, and web_serv is the class name of the web service. (Typically, /csp/app is /csp/namespace, where namespace is the namespace that contains the web application and the production. )

For example:

https://devsys/csp/mysamples/MyApp.StockService.cls?WSDL

The browser displays the WSDL document as an XML document. The following shows an example:

Creating a Web Service in a Production

### 2.5 Web Service Example

The following simple example shows a production web service that can be used to look up customer information, given a customer ID.

Class Definition

Class ESOAP.WebService Extends EnsLib.SOAP.Service
{

Parameter ADAPTER;

Parameter NAMESPACE = "http://www.myapp.org";

Parameter SERVICENAME = "CustomerLookupService";

Method GetCustomerInfo(ID As %Numeric) As ESOAP.SOAPResponse [WebMethod]
{
//create request message with given ID
set request=##class(ESOAP.CustomerRequest).%New()
set request.CustomerID=ID

//send request message
set sc= ..SendRequestSync("GetCustomerInfoBO",request,.response)
if $$$ISERR(sc) do ..ReturnMethodStatusFault(sc)

//use info from InterSystems IRIS response to create SOAP response
set soapresponse=##class(ESOAP.SOAPResponse).%New()
set soapresponse.CustomerID=response.CustomerID set soapresponse.Name=response.Name set soapresponse.Street=response.Street set soapresponse.City=response.City set soapresponse.State=response.State set soapresponse.Zip=response.Zip

quit soapresponse
}

}

The SOAP response class is as follows:

Class Definition

///
Class ESOAP.SOAPResponse Extends (%RegisteredObject, %XML.Adaptor)
{

Property CustomerID As %Numeric;
Property Name As %String;
Property Street As %String;
Property City As %String;
Property State As %String;
Property Zip As %Numeric;

}

Note the following points:

- The example web method (GetCustomerInfo) uses SendRequestSync() to communicate with a business operation elsewhere in the production. The method receives a response message and uses it to create a SOAP response message.

- The SOAP response class has the same properties as the corresponding production message response class. Unlike the production message response, however, the SOAP response class is XML-enabled and non-persistent.

Enabling SOAP Sessions

### 2.6 Enabling SOAP Sessions

The SOAP specification does not include session support. Ho wever, it is often useful to maintain a session between a web client and the web service that it uses. You can do this with a production web service. If a web service uses sessions, it establishes a session ID and allows repeated calls on the service after one successfully authenticated call from a client.

Support for SOAP sessions is controlled by the SOAPSESSION class parameter. The default is 0, which means that the web service does not use sessions.

To enable SOAP sessions, create a subclass of EnsLib.SOAP.Service and set SOAPSESSION to 1 in the subclass. Base your production web service on this subclass.

For more information on SOAP sessions, see Creating Web Services and Web Clients.

### 2.7 Additional Options

Because your production web service extends %SOAP.WebService, you can use all the SOAP support provided by that
class. This support includes options for the following customizations, among others:

- Customizing the SOAP headers

- Passing attachments in the SOAP messages

- Changing the binding style of the SOAP messages from document-style (the default) to rpc-style

- Changing the encoding style of the messages from literal (the default) to SOAP-encoded

- Customizing the XML types used in the SOAP messages

- Customizing the SOAPAction header used to invoke a web method

- Controlling whether elements are qualified (controlling the elementF ormDefault attribute of the web service)

- Controlling the form of null arguments (to be an empty element rather than omitted)

- Writing the web method to have output parameters instead of return values For these options and others, see Creating Web Services and Web Clients.

### 2.8 Adding and Configuring the Web Service

To add your production web service (a business service) to a production, use the Management Portal to do the following:

1. Add an instance of your custom class to the production.

Important:

Ensure that the configuration name is the same as the full class name, including package. This is a requirement for running a production web service.

2. Enable the business service.

3. Set the Pool Size setting to 0.

For other settings, see Configuring Productions .

4. Run the production.

Creating a Web Client in a Production

This topic describes how to create an InterSystems IRIS® Interoperability web client. At a high level, your InterSystems IRIS Interoperability web client receives InterSystems IRIS Interoperability requests from elsewhere within the production, converts them to SOAP requests, and sends them to the appropriate web service. Similarly, it receives SOAP responses, converts them into InterSystems IRIS responses, and sends them back within the production.

Tip:

InterSystems IRIS also provides specialized business service classes that use SOAP, and one of those might be suitable for your needs. If so, no programming would be needed. See Connectivity Options.

### 3.1 Overview

An InterSystems IRIS Interoperability web client consists of the following parts:

- A proxy client class that defines a proxy method for each method defined by the web service. Each proxy method uses the same signature used by the corresponding web service method and invokes that method when requested.

- A business operation that uses the InterSystems IRIS Interoperability SOAP outbound adapter to invoke the proxy client.

- Supporting classes as needed to define XML types and production messages.

The following figure sho ws how the business operation, adapter, and proxy client class work together. Supporting classes are not shown here.

Creating a Web Client in a Production

In the preceding figure, all items within dashed lines can be generated programmatically . You can then edit this code as needed.

For a more detailed look at these parts, see InterSystems IRIS Support for Web Clients.

### 3.2 Basic Steps

This section outlines the basic steps to create an InterSystems IRIS Interoperability web client.

To create an InterSystems IRIS Interoperability web client:

1. Programmatically generate business operation class, proxy client class, and supporting classes, as described below.

2. Check whether you need to adjust the types of the inputs and outputs of the methods, as described below.

#### 3.2.1 Generating the Client Classes

To generate a set of web client classes for a given WSDL:

1. Create an instance of %SOAP.WSDL.Reader.

2. Optionally set properties to control the behavior of your instance.

Generated Classes for an InterSystems IRIS Interoperability Web Client

Property

CompileFlags

MakePersistent

MakeSerial

OutputTypeAttribute

MakeBusinessOperation

Purpose

Specifies the flags to use when compiling the generated classes. The initial
expression is "dk"; use $System.OBJ.ShowFlags() to get information
on the available flags.

If this property is 1, the proxy client is a persistent object; otherwise, it is a
registered object. The initial expression is 0.

If this property is 1 and if MakePersistent is 1, the proxy client is a serial class. The initial expression is 0.

Controls how the WSDL reader sets the OUTPUTTYPEATTRIBUTE
parameter in the proxy client that it generates; which controls the use of
the xsi:type attribute in the SOAP messages. See Creating Web Services and Web Clients.

Specifies whether to generate a business operation and related request and response objects. The ADAPTER setting for this business operation is EnsLib.SOAP.OutboundAdapter. This option works only if you are working within an interoperability-enabled namespace.

For other properties, see the class documentation for %SOAP.WSDL.Reader.

3.

Invoke the Process() method, providing the following arguments:

- The first ar gument must be the URL of the WSDL of the web service or the name of the WSDL file (including its complete path). Depending on the configuration of the web service, it may be necessary to append a string that
provides a suitable username and password; see the examples.

- The optional second argument is the name of the package in which the reader should place the generated classes. If you do not specify a package, InterSystems IRIS uses the service name as the package name.

#### 3.2.2 Generated Classes and XMLKEEPCLASS

When you generate web client classes, you specify the package for the classes. If this package is the same as an existing package, by default the tool will overwrite any existing classes that have the same name. To prevent InterSystems IRIS from overwriting a class definition, add the XMLKEEPCLASS parameter to that class and set this parameter equal to 1.

### 3.3 Generated Classes for an InterSystems IRIS Interoperability Web Client

This section provides information about the generated web client classes.

Consider a web service named MyService that has the following details:

- It is hosted at https://devsys/csp/mysamples/MyApp.AddService.CLS

- The target XML namespace for the web service is http://www.myapp.org

- It defines a web method named AddService, which accepts two complex numbers as arguments and returns the result.

Creating a Web Client in a Production

Suppose that you generate a web client for this web service. If you specify the package for the client classes as MyClient,
InterSystems IRIS generates the following classes:

- It generates the MyClient.BusOp.MyServiceSoap class, which defines the b usiness operation.

Class MyClient.BusOp.MyServiceSoap Extends Ens.BusinessOperation
{

Parameter ADAPTER = "EnsLib.SOAP.OutboundAdapter";

Method Add(pRequest As MyClient.BusOp.AddRequest,
Output pResponse As MyClient.BusOp.AddResponse) As %Library.Status
{
Set:""=..Adapter.WebServiceClientClass ..Adapter.WebServiceClientClass = "MyClient.MyServiceSoap"

Set tSC = ..Adapter.InvokeMethod("Add",.AddResult,
pRequest.a,pRequest.b) Quit:$$$ISERR(tSC) tSC

Set tSC = pRequest.NewResponse(.pResponse) Quit:$$$ISERR(tSC) tSC
Set pResponse.AddResult=AddResult
Quit $$$OK
}

XData MessageMap
{
<MapItems>
<MapItem MessageType="MyClient.BusOp.AddRequest">
<Method>Add</Method>
</MapItem>
</MapItems>
}

}

- It generates the MyClient.AddServiceSOAP class, the proxy client class:

Class Definition

Class MyClient.AddServiceSoap Extends %SOAP.WebClient
{

/// This is the URL used to access the web service.
Parameter LOCATION = "https://devsys/csp/mysamples/MyApp.AddService.cls";

/// This is the namespace used by the Service
Parameter NAMESPACE = "http://www.myapp.org";

/// Use xsi:type attribute for literal types.
Parameter OUTPUTTYPEATTRIBUTE = 1;

/// This is the name of the Service
Parameter SERVICENAME = "AddService";

Method Add(a As MyClient.ComplexNumber, b As MyClient.ComplexNumber)
As MyClient.ComplexNumber [ Final, SoapBindingStyle = document, SoapBodyUse = literal, WebMethod ]
{
Quit ..WebMethod("Add").Invoke($this,
"http://www.myapp.org/MyApp.AddService.Add",.a,.b)
}

}

- It generates the request and response message classes needed by the business operation. The request class is as follows:

Class Definition

Class MyClient.BusOp.AddRequest Extends Ens.Request
{

Parameter RESPONSECLASSNAME = "MyClient.BusOp.AddResponse";

Property a As MyClient.ComplexNumber;

Property b As MyClient.ComplexNumber;

}

The response class is as follows:

Class Definition

Class MyClient.BusOp.AddResponse Extends Ens.Response
{

Property AddResult As MyClient.ComplexNumber;

}

- Finally, it generates the MyClient.ComplexNumber class, which defines a comple x number and which is used by the other classes.

Class Definition

/// Created from: http://devsys/csp/mysamples/MyApp.AddService.CLS?WSDL=1
Class MyClient.ComplexNumber Extends (%RegisteredObject, %XML.Adaptor)
{
Parameter XMLNAME = "ComplexNumber";

Parameter XMLSEQUENCE = 1;

Property Real As %xsd.double(XMLNAME = "Real") [ SqlFieldName = _Real ];

Property Imaginary As %xsd.double(XMLNAME = "Imaginary");

}

When you compile these classes, the compiler also generates a class for each method defined in the web service. These classes are not automatically added to your project and their internal details are subject to change. These classes extend %SOAP.ProxyDescriptor, which you should never subclass yourself.

### 3.4 Creating a Business Operation Class Manually

Rather than using the generated business operation class, you can create your own class. This section describes how to do
so. It discusses the following:

- Basic requirements of the business operation class

- Basic requirements of the methods

- Specific techniques, with e xamples, for calling the proxy methods

- Reference information for the adapter property and methods used here

#### 3.4.1 Basic Requirements of the Class

The following list describes the basic requirements of the business operation class:

- Your business operation class should extend Ens.BusinessOperation.

- In your class, the ADAPTER parameter should equal EnsLib.SOAP.OutboundAdapter.

- In your class, the INVOCATION parameter should specify the invocation style you want to use, which must be one of the following.

–

Queue means the message is created within one background job and placed on a queue, at which time the original job is released. Later, when the message is processed, a different background job will be allocated for the task. This is the most common setting.

Creating a Web Client in a Production

–

InProc means the message will be formulated, sent, and delivered in the same job in which it was created. The job will not be released to the sender’s pool until the message is delivered to the target. This is only suitable for special cases.

- Your class should define one method for each method of the proxy client, as described in the follo wing section.

- Your class should define a message map that includes one entry for each method. A message map is an XData block
entry that has the following structure:

XData MessageMap
{
<MapItems>
<MapItem MessageType="messageclass">
<Method>methodname</Method>
</MapItem>
...
</MapItems>
}

You will also need to define the production message classes that the b usiness operation uses.

#### 3.4.2 Basic Requirements of the Methods

Within your business operation class, your methods should invoke the proxy methods. Here the general requirements are
as follows:

1. The method should have the same signature as the proxy method that it is invoking.

2. The method should be marked with the WebMethod keyword.

3. The method should set the SoapBindingStyle and SoapBodyUse keywords as expected by the proxy client. (That is,

use the same values as in the signature of the corresponding proxy method.)

4. The method should set the WebServiceClientClass property of the adapter. When this property is set, a proxy client

instance is created and placed in the %Client property of the adapter.

5. The method should call the corresponding proxy method, using one of the techniques in the next section.

6. The method should check the status.

7. Then:

- In the case of success, create a new response message (via the NewResponse() method of the request) and set its properties as appropriate.

- In the case of failure, quit with the error.

#### 3.4.3 Ways to Execute the Proxy Methods

Within your business operation, your methods should execute the proxy methods of the proxy client class. You can do this in multiple ways, which are best shown via an example. This section uses an example web service that has a web method named GetStock that accepts a stock symbol (a string) and returns a number. Suppose that you have used generated a proxy client (GetStock.StockServiceSoap), which contains a method called GetStock.

Also suppose that you have created message classes as follows:

Class Definition

Class GetStock.BusOp.GetQuoteRequest Extends Ens.Request
{

Parameter RESPONSECLASSNAME = "GetStock.BusOp.GetQuoteResponse";

Property StockName As %String;

}

And

Class Definition

Class GetStock.BusOp.GetQuoteResponse Extends Ens.Response
{

Property StockValue As %Numeric;

}

To execute the proxy method GetStock, your business operation class can do any of the following:

- Call the InvokeMethod() method of the adapter and specify the name of the proxy method to run, as well as any number of arguments. In this case, there is only one argument (which we specify as pRequest.StockName). For
example:

- Class Member

Method GetQuote1(pRequest As GetStock.BusOp.GetQuoteRequest,
{

set status = ..Adapter.InvokeMethod("GetQuote",.answer,pRequest.StockName)
if $$$ISERR(status) quit status

set pResponse=##class(GetStock.BusOp.GetQuoteResponse).%New()
set pResponse.GetQuoteResult=answer
quit $$$OK
}

Access the %Client property of the adapter, which gives you an instance of the proxy client class, and execute the proxy method of that property. The %Client property is set when you set the WebServiceClientClass property. In this case,
%Client has a method named GetQuote, which accepts a string stock symbol. For example:

Class Member

Method GetQuote2(pRequest As GetStock.BusOp.GetQuoteRequest,
{

set client=..Adapter.%Client set answer=client.GetQuote("GRPQ")

set pResponse=##class(GetStock.BusOp.GetQuoteResponse).%New()
set pResponse.GetQuoteResult=answer
quit $$$OK
}

Note that with this technique, you do not have access to the retry logic of InterSystems IRIS.

- Create a proxy method object by calling the WebMethod() method of the adapter. Set properties of this object as
appropriate (one property per named argument). In this case, WebMethod() returns an object with one property:
StockName. After setting properties as needed, call the Invoke() method of that object. For example:

Creating a Web Client in a Production

Class Member

Method GetQuote3(pRequest As GetStock.BusOp.GetQuoteRequest,
{

set proxymethod=..Adapter.WebMethod("GetQuote")
set proxymethod.StockName=pRequest.StockName

set status=..Adapter.Invoke(proxymethod)
if $$$ISERR(status) quit status

set pResponse=##class(GetStock.BusOp.GetQuoteResponse).%New()
set pResponse.GetQuoteResult=proxymethod.%Result
quit $$$OK
}

In this case, you can provide any number of arguments.

#### 3.4.4 Reference Information

This section provides reference information for the adapter property and methods mentioned in the previous section.

%Client property

%SOAP.WebClient

The associated instance of the proxy client (an instance of %SOAP.WebClient). This property is set when you set the WebServiceClientClass property of the adapter.

InvokeMethod() method

Method InvokeMethod(pMethodName As %String,
Output pResult As %RegisteredObject, pArgs...) As %Status

Calls the specified method of the proxy client class, passing all the ar guments and returns the status. The output is returned by reference as the second argument.

WebMethod() method

Method WebMethod(pMethodName As %String) As %SOAP.ProxyDescriptor

Returns an object that corresponds to the specified method. This object has one property corresponding to each
method argument; you should set this properties before using the Invoke() method. For details on
%SOAP.ProxyDescriptor, see the class reference.

Invoke() method

Method Invoke(pWebMethod As %SOAP.ProxyDescriptor) As %Status

Calls the given method and returns the status.

### 3.5 Adding and Configuring the Web Client

To add your InterSystems IRIS Interoperability web client to a production, use the Management Portal to do the following:

Adding and Configuring the Web Client

1. Add an instance of your custom business operation class to the production, specifically the generated b usiness operation

class.

2. Enable the business operation.

3. Specify appropriate values for the runtime settings of the associated adapter, as discussed below.

4. Run the production.

The following subsections describes the runtime settings for your IRIS Interoperability web client, which fall into several
general groups:

- Basic settings

- Settings related to credentials

- The setting that controls use of TLS

- Settings that control the use of a proxy server For settings not listed here, see Settings in All Productions.

#### 3.5.1 Specifying Basics

The following settings specify the basic information for the InterSystems IRIS Interoperability web client:

- Web Service URL

- Web Service Client Class

- Response Timeout

#### 3.5.2 Specifying Credentials

The web service that you are accessing might require a username and password. In general, the InterSystems IRIS Interop-
erability SOAP client can log in to a web service in either of the following ways:

- You can use WS-Security user authentication. In this case, you include a WS-Security header in the SOAP request;
this header includes the username and password. The proxy client automatically does this if you specify a value for the SOAP Credentials setting.

- CAUTION:

Ensure that you are using TLS between the web client and the web service. The WS-Security header is sent in clear text, so this technique is not secure unless TLS is used.

You can use basic HTTP user authentication, which is less secure than WS-Security but is sometimes required. In this case, you include the username and password in the HTTP header of the SOAP request. The proxy client automatically does this if you specify a value for the Credentials setting.

Use the technique that is appropriate for the web service you are using.

#### 3.5.3 Specifying a TLS Configuration

If your web server supports it, you can connect with TLS. To do so, specify a value for the SSL Configuration setting.

Note:

You must also ensure the web service is at a URL that uses https://. The web service location is determined
by the Web Service URL setting; if this is not specified, the InterSystems IRIS Interoperability web client assumes
the web service is at the URL specified by the LOCATION parameter in the proxy client class.

Creating a Web Client in a Production

#### 3.5.4 Specifying a Proxy Server

You can communicate with the web service via a proxy server. To set this up, use Proxy Server and other settings in the Proxy Settings group.

Configuring a Production for SOAP
Services

This topic briefly discusses ho w to configure your system so that you can use HTTP and SO AP services through the Web port. This information is intended to help you set up a development or test system for these services. Complete information about these topics is provided in the documentation. See Configuring System-W ide Settings for more details.

To set up an InterSystems IRIS® development or test system for HTTP or SOAP services, follow these steps:

1.

If you are not using an existing namespace, create a new namespace.

2. Create an empty role and assign it to the unknown user:

a. Select System Administration, Security, and Roles to display the Roles portal page.

b. Click the Create New Role button and name the role, for example, Services_Role, and click the Save button.

c. Select the Members tab, select the Unknown User, click the right arrow, and click the Assign button.

3. Define a web application that will handle calls to the Web port. The web application name defines the root of the URL

that will call the service. A single web application can support multiple business services but they must all have a class that is the same or a subclass of the web application dispatch class.

a. Select System Administration, Security, Applications, and Web Applications to display the Web Applications portal

page. Click the Create New Web Application button.

b. Name the web application, such as /weatherapp or /math/sum. You must start the name with a / (slash)

character.

c. Set the Namespace to the namespace that the production is running in, such as SERVICESNS. Leave the Namespace

Default Application unchecked.

d. You can check the Application, CSP/ZEN, and Inbound Web Services check boxes.

e. Leave the Resource Required and Group By ID fields empty .

f. Check the Unauthenticated check box on the Allowed Authentication Methods line.

Or for an alternative, see the tip after this list.

g. Click Save.

h. Select the Matching Roles tab.

i.

In the Select a Matching Role: field, select the role that you created in the pre vious step.

Configuring a Production for SOAP Services

j.

In the Select target roles to add to the selected matching role field, select the role or roles associated with the namespace globals and routines. The globals and routines may be in the same database or in separate databases. If your service accesses another InterSystems IRIS database, you should also select its role. You can select multiple roles while holding the Ctrl key.

Note:

The globals database also may have a secondary database and a corresponding role, such as %DB_GDBSECONDARY. This secondary database is used to store passwords. You don’t need access to this database for pass-through services and operations, but if you create a custom web service that uses password access, you should also add the secondary database role to the target database.

k. After the roles are highlighted, click the right-arrow key to move them to the Selected text box.

l.

Then click the Assign button.

Tip:

If you want to authenticate users:

1. Create a new class, extending EnsLib.SOAP.GenericService.

2.

In this class, override the parameter SECURITYIN, setting it to either ALLOW or REQUIRE.

3. Use this new class when configuring the b usiness service.

4. Use the WS-Security Username Token when invoking the service.

5.

In the web application configuration, clear the Unauthenticated option.

B

Using the SOAP Inbound Adapter

This topic briefly discusses the class EnsLib.SOAP.InboundAdapter, which you can use as an alternative to EnsLib.SOAP.Service (described in Creating a Web Service in a Production).

The standard way to create a web service in an interoperability production is to create a subclass of EnsLib.SOAP.Service and set up a web server to be your production web server. In this way, your system will be able to utilize all the SOAP and security features provided by a commercial web server and the InterSystems IRIS® SOAP framework. In contrast, using the EnsLib.SOAP.InboundAdapter is easier to configure and lighter weight b ut doing so bypasses the above mentioned formal web support machinery. Also, the adapter does not expose the WSDL and test page the way the standard InterSystems IRIS SOAP framework does.

B.1 Notes

The SOAP inbound adapter (EnsLib.SOAP.InboundAdapter) does not require web server software. Instead it spawns a TCP listener job using the InterSystems IRIS super server. This lets you run your service in a foreground window, which is useful for debugging. (To do this, you must be running the service locally. Also make sure the PoolSize setting is 1 and the JobPerConnection setting is false.) It also supports TLS.

The EnsLib.SOAP.InboundAdapter listens for HTTP input on a given port. When the adapter receives input, the following
occurs:

1.

2.

3.

It extracts the HTTP SOAPaction header.

It creates a stream (%Library.GlobalBinaryStream) that contains the body of the input.

It calls the web method that corresponds to the given SOAPaction.

This adapter provides an advantage in that it supports persistent connections for successive SOAP calls. Also, if you use it with JobPerConnection=0, it can retain expensively instantiated resources such as XPath parsers even across successive connections that encompass individual SOAP service calls.

B.2 Development Tasks

To use the InterSystems IRIS SOAP inbound adapter, write and compile a new business service class in an IDE. The fol-
lowing list describes the basic requirements:

Using the SOAP Inbound Adapter

- Your class should extend EnsLib.SOAP.Service. This class extends both Ens.BusinessService (so that it is a business service) and %SOAP.WebService (so that it can act as a web service as well).

- Your class should provide values for SERVICENAME and other parameters, as described in Basic Requirements.

- The class should define web methods, as described in Defining Web Methods for Use in InterSystems IRIS.

Optionally, to disable support for calls via the adapter in your service, add this to your class:

Parameter ADAPTER="";

B.3 Configuration Tasks

Use the Management Portal to do the following:

1. Add an instance of your custom class to the production.

Important:

Ensure that the configuration name is the same as the full class name, including package. This is a requirement for running a production web service.

2. Enable the business service.

3. Set the PoolSize setting to 1 so that the adapter can use its TCP listener.

4. Set the StayConnected setting to 0. Otherwise, clients may hang for their timeout period while waiting for the server

to drop the connection.

5. Specify other settings as needed; see Settings for the SOAP Inbound Adapter.

6. Run the production.

Older Web Service Variation

In previous releases, an InterSystems IRIS® web method could not directly call SendRequestSync(), SendRequestAsync(), or SendDeferredResponse(). An alternative approach was needed. This topic provides the details, for the benefit of an yone who is maintaining code that uses this alternative approach.

C.1 Overview

In previous releases, an InterSystems IRIS web method could not directly call SendRequestSync(), SendRequestAsync(), or SendDeferredResponse(). Instead, there were two requirements for a production web service, in addition to the basic
requirements:

- Each web method had to invoke the internal ProcessInput() method as appropriate, passing to it the appropriate request production message and receiving a response message.

- The web service class had to define the OnProcessInput() callback method. In this method, you would call SendRequestSync(), SendRequestAsync(), or SendDeferredResponse().

The following figure sho ws the overall flo w of request messages in this scenario:

InsideProductionOutsideProd...WebService/BusinessServiceotherparts...RequestSOAPresp...SOAPrequ...Webmethod:ReceiveSOAPrequestmessageCr...ProcessInput()method:PerforminternalactivitiesFor...OnProcessInput()method:Sendrequestmessageproduction...request

Older Web Service Variation

C.2 Implementing the OnProcessInput() Method

The OnProcessInput() method has the following signature:

Method OnProcessInput(pInput As %RegisteredObject,
ByRef pOutput As %RegisteredObject, ByRef pHint As %String) As %Status

Here:

1.

2.

3.

pInput is the request message that you are sending.

pOutput is the response message that is sent in return.

pHint is an optional string that you can use to decide how to handle the InterSystems IRIS request; see Using the pHint
Argument.

The following shows an example:

Class Member

Method OnProcessInput(pInput As %RegisteredObject, ByRef pOutput As %RegisteredObject) As %Status
{
set sc= ..SendRequestSync("Lookup",pInput,.pOutput) Quit sc
}

C.2.1 Using the pHint Argument

If a web service defined multiple methods, and you w anted to send them to different destinations within the production, you used the optional hint argument of the internal ProcessInput() method and the OnProcessInput() callback method,
as follows:

1. When invoking ProcessInput(), you used a value for the hint argument to indicate which web method is making this

call. For example:

Method GetCustomerInfo(ID As %Numeric) As ESOAP.SOAPResponse [ WebMethod ]
{
//create request message with given ID
set request=##class(ESOAP.CustomerRequest).%New()
set request.CustomerID=ID

//send request message
//ProcessInput() calls OnProcessInput(), which actually
//sends the message
set sc=..ProcessInput(request,.response,"GetCustomerInfo") ...

quit soapresponse
}

2. Within OnProcessInput(), you used the hint argument to determine the flo w. For example:

Class Member

Method OnProcessInputAlt(pInput As %RegisteredObject,
ByRef pOutput As %RegisteredObject, pHint As %String) As %Status
{
if pHint="GetCustomerInfo"{
set sc= ..SendRequestSync("GetCustomerInfoBO",pInput,.pOutput)
}
elseif pHint="GetStoreInfo" {
set sc= ..SendRequestSync("GetStoreInfoBO",pInput,.pOutput)
}
Quit sc
}

The remaining settings are common to all business services. For information, see Settings for All Business Services.

Adapter URL
A specific URL for the service to accept requests on. F or SOAP services invoked through the SOAP inbound adapter on a custom local port, this setting allows a custom URL to be used instead of the standard csp/namespace/classname style of
URL.

Allowed IP Addresses Specifies a comma-separated list of remote IP addresses from which to accept connections. The adapter accepts IP addresses
in dotted decimal form. An optional :port designation is supported, so either of the following address formats is acceptable:
##### 192.168.1.22 or 192.168.1.22:3298.

Note:

IP address filtering is a means to control access on pri vate networks, rather than for publicly accessible systems. InterSystems does not recommend relying on IP address filtering as a sole security mechanism, as it is possible for attackers to spoof IP addresses.

If a port number is specified, connections from other ports will be refused.

If the string starts with an exclamation point (!) character, the inbound adapter initiates the connection rather than waiting for an incoming connection request. The inbound adapter initiates the connection to the specified address and then w aits for a message. In this case, only one address may be given, and if a port is specified, it supersedes the v alue of the Port
setting; otherwise, the Port setting is used.

Call Interval
Specifies the number of seconds that the adapter will listen for incoming data from its configured source, before checking for a shutdown signal from the production framework.

If the adapter finds input, it acquires the data and passes it to the b usiness service. The business service processes the data, and then the adapter immediately begins waiting for new input. This cycle continues whenever the production is running and the business service is enabled and scheduled to be active.

The default is 5 seconds. The minimum is 0.1 seconds.

Settings for the SOAP Inbound Adapter

Enable Standard Requests If this setting is true, the adapter can also receive SOAP requests in the usual way (that is, via the Web Gateway port, rather than the TCP connection). The default is false.

Note:

Note that if the adapter uses the Web Gateway port, First-In-First-Out processing for messages is not supported.

Gateway Timeout
Specifies the e xpected timeout (in seconds) of the external TCP socket system.

The default value is “IRIS” which allows the adapter to use the IRIS web gateway timeout value found in the request headers as long as the incoming request comes through an IRIS web application. Otherwise, the default value will be 60 seconds.

Generate SuperSession ID This setting controls whether the message will have a SuperSessionID, which can be used to identify messages that cross from one production to another. For details, see Supersessions.

Job Per Connection If this setting is true, the adapter spawns a new job to handle each incoming TCP connection and allows simultaneous handling of multiple connections. When false, it does not spawn a new job for each connection. The default is true.

Local Interface
Specifies the netw ork interface through which the connection should go. Select a value from the list or type a value. An empty value means use any interface.

OS Accept Connection Queue Size Specifies the number of incoming connections should the operating system should hold open. Set to 0 if only one connection at a time is expected. Set to a large number if many clients will connecting rapidly.

Override Client Response Wait Timeout Specifies the e xpected response wait time (in seconds) for the client.

The default is 0 which uses the timeout set by the client.

If the client is an IRIS Interoperability production SOAP operation, the client response time will be included in the HTTP headers.

Port
Identifies the TCP port on the local machine where the adapter is listening for SOAP requests. Avoid specifying a port number that is in the range used by the operating system for ephemeral outbound connections.

Read Timeout
Specifies the number of seconds to w ait for each successive incoming TCP read operation, following receipt of initial data from the remote TCP port. The default is 5 seconds. The range is 0–600 seconds (a maximum of 10 minutes).

SSL Config
The name of an existing TLS configuration to use to authenticate this connection. This should be a server configuration.

To create and manage TLS configurations, use the Management Portal. See InterSystems TLS Guide. The first field on the Edit SSL/TLS Configuration page is Configuration Name. Use this string as the value for the SSLConfig setting.

Stay Connected
Specifies whether to k eep the connection open between requests.

- If this setting is 0, the adapter will disconnect immediately after every event.

- If this setting is -1, the adapter auto-connects on startup and then stays connected.

- This setting can also be positive (which specifies the idle time, in seconds), b ut such a value is not useful for this adapter, which works by polling. If the idle time is longer than the polling interval (that is, the CallInterval) the adapter stays connected all the time. If the idle time is shorter than the polling interval, the adapter disconnects and reconnects at every polling interval.

Support Delayed Sync Request Specifies whether delayed sync requests are enabled. The default is disabled.

If the client provides unique ClientRequestKey and ClientRetryRequestKey, then the SendRequestSync carried out by this service will attempt to prevent processing the same request multiple times if the client times out waiting for the initial response and retries.

Provides reference information for settings of the SOAP outbound adapter, EnsLib.SOAP.OutboundAdapter. You can configure these settings after you have added a business operation that uses this adapter to your production.

Summary
The outbound SOAP adapter has the following settings:

Group

SSL Configuration, SSL Check Server Identity

Proxy Settings

Proxy Server, Proxy Port, Proxy HTTPS, ProxyHttpTunnel, ProxyHttpSSLConnect

Include Request Key In HTTP Header

Additional Settings

ResponseTimeout, HttpVersion, ConnectTimeout, SendSuperSession

The remaining settings are common to all business operations. For information, see Settings for All Business Operations.

ConnectTimeout
Specifies the number of seconds to w ait for the connection to the server to open. The default value is 5.

If the connection is not opened in this time period, the adapter retries repeatedly, up to the number of times given by Failure Timeout divided by Retry Interval.

Credentials
Specify the ID of the production credentials that contain the username and password to be used in the HTTP header. See Defining Production Credentials .

HttpVersion
Specifies the HTTP v ersion that the adapter should report in the HTTP request it sends to the server.

Include Request Key in HTTP Header Specifies whether the request k ey should be included in the HTTP headers. The default is disabled.

If checked, the key will either be VND.InterSystems.IRIS.RequestKey or VND.InterSystems.IRIS.RetryRequestKey and have a value of a System GUID, the current namespace, and the current request header ID.

The HTTP header will also include VND.InterSystems.IRIS.ResponseTimeout and have a value of ResponseTimeout.

This setting is intended to be used in conjunction with an IRIS Interoperability production SOAP service with delayed response support enabled.

This setting should not be enabled if the request payload is changed by the host class on retrying and has a different expected response from the original request.

ProxyHTTPS
Specifies whether the proxy (if an y) uses HTTPS to communicate with the real HTTP/HTTPS server.

ProxyHttpTunnel
Specifies whether the adapter uses the HTTP CONNECT command to establish a tunnel through the proxy to the tar get HTTP server. If true, the request uses the HTTP CONNECT command to establish a tunnel. The address of the proxy server is taken from the Proxy Server and Proxy Port properties. If Proxy Https SSL Connect is true, then once the tunnel is established, InterSystems IRIS® negotiates the TLS connection. The default value is false.

ProxyPort
Specifies the proxy serv er port on which to send HTTP requests, if using a proxy server. The default value is 80.

ProxyServer
Specifies the proxy serv er through which to send HTTP requests, if any.

ProxyHttpSSLConnect
Specifies whether the adapter should use a proxy TLS connection to the proxy. Note that the use of TLS to the eventual endpoint is determined by the protocol part of web service's location URL.

ResponseTimeout
Specifies the timeout for getting a response from the remote web serv er (the timeout for opening the connection to the server is set by ConnectTimeout). The default value is 30.

SendSuperSession
Controls whether to include the SuperSessionID property in the outgoing message. For details, see Supersessions.

SOAPCredentials
Specify the ID of the production credentials that contain the username and password to be used in the WS-Security header of the SOAP request. See Defining Production Credentials . For more information on WS-Security support, see Securing
Web Services.

SSLCheckServerIdentity
Specifies that when making a TLS connection, the adapter should check that the server identity in the certificate matches the name of the system being connecting to. This defaults to specifying that the check should be made. Uncheck this for test and development systems where the name specified in the TLS certificate does not match the DNS name.

SSLConfig
The name of an existing TLS configuration to use to authenticate this connection. Choose a client TLS configuration, because the web client initiates the communication.

To create and manage TLS configurations, use the Management Portal. See InterSystems TLS Guide. The first field on the Edit SSL/TLS Configuration page is Configuration Name. Use this string as the value for the SSLConfig setting.

Note:

You must also ensure the web service is at a URL that uses https://. The web service location is determined
by the WebServiceURL setting; if this is not specified, the InterSystems IRIS web client assumes the web service
is at the URL specified by the LOCATION parameter in proxy client class.

WebServiceClientClass
Specifies the full name (including package) of the proxy client class, specifically the class that actually sends and recei SOAP messages to the web service.

ves

WebServiceURL
Specifies the URL where the web service is located. If this setting is not gi ven, the adapter uses the default location (the
LOCATION parameter) declared in the proxy client class; see the WebServiceClientClass setting. Note that TLS will only
work if this URL uses https://
