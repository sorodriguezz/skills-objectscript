#### 1.2.4 Interoperability Usage

To view the Interoperability Usage page in the management portal, navigate to System Operation > Interoperability Usage, then click Go.

This page offers the following views:

- Interface

- Message Volume

- Database Impact For all views you can specify the date range of interest using Start Date and End Date.

The Interface View

The Interface view displays the number of different interfaces run by your system in the given namespace during the time span from Start Date to End Date. For example, if a specific b usiness service is run multiple times, that counts as one inbound interface, while two business operations running once each count as two outbound interfaces.

In the Interface view, the table has the following columns:

Table 1–12:

Namespace

Type

Total

Visible only when you choose Per Namespace. The namespace in which the interfaces being counted are running.

The type or category of interface. Categories include Inbound (business services), Outbound (business operations), and Web API.

The number of unique interfaces of the specified type that have run during the specified time range (in the specified namespace if applicable).

The Message Volume View

The Message Volume view displays the number of inbound and outbound interoperability messages sent or received per day during a specified time span. You can choose Per Namespace to view the data by namespace or choose Summary to view these numbers in the aggregate.

In the Message Volume view, the table can have the following columns:

Table 1–13:

Date

Namespace

Type

Volume

A single date for which message volume data is displayed.

Visible only when you choose Per Namespace. The namespace in which the messages being counted are sent or received.

The type or category of interface. Categories include Inbound (business services) and Outbound (business operations).

The number of unique messages of the specified type that have run on the specified date (in the specified namespace if applicable)

The Database Impact View

The Database Impact view displays the change in size (in MB) of the database where interoperability metrics data are stored, over the period defined by Start Date and End Date. This data reflects the total size of messages recei ved during that timespan. You can choose Per Namespace to view the data by namespace or choose Summary to view these numbers by database.

In the Database Impact view, the table can have the following columns:

Table 1–14:

Database

Namespace

Data Created

Visible only when you choose Summary. The database for which the size delta is being displayed.

Visible only when you choose Per Namespace. The namespace that contains the databases whose total size delta is being displayed.

The change in size (measured in MB) of the specified database or namespace.

Monitoring Locks

### 1.3 Monitoring Locks

InterSystems IRIS locks are created when an InterSystems IRIS process issues a LOCK command on an ObjectScript local variable or global variable, as long as the entity is not already locked by another process. Entities need not exist in the database to lock them. See Locking and Concurrency Control.

To display locks system-wide, navigate to the View Locks page (System Operation > Locks > View Locks). To delete selected locks system-wide, navigate to the Manage Locks page (System Operation > Locks > Manage Locks). In both cases, the displayed lock table lists one row for each held lock and for each waiting lock request, identifying the owner. A single row may identify multiple locks held by an owner on the same entity. For example, holding an incremented lock or holding both a Shared lock and an Exclusive lock. If more than one process holds a lock on the same entity, each owner has its own row.

Optionally select either or both of the following check boxes at the top of this page, to include additional information if
needed. This information is not included by default, for performance reasons:

- Owner’s routine information. This option adds the Routine column to the display.

- SQL table name. This option adds the SQL table name column to the display.

The Lock Table has the following column entries.

Column Heading

Definition

Owner

The process ID of the process holding or waiting for the lock. Contains the client system name if it is a remote lock.

OS User Name

Username assigned to the process holding or waiting for this lock.

Mode count

Lock mode and lock increment count. If the lock count is 1 the count is not displayed. For a list of ModeCount values, refer to Managing the Lock Table.

Reference

Lock reference string of the lock item (does not include the database name).

SQL table name

The name of the SQL table, if any, associated with the lock reference. To see this column, you must select the SQL table name check box.

Directory

System

Routine

Remove

The database location of the lock item.

The system name of where the lock is located. If it is the local system the column is blank.

The routine line currently being executed by the process holding or waiting for the lock. To see this column, you must select the Owner’s routine information check box.

Manage Locks only: If this lock is removable, this option along with the Remove all locks for process option (for local locks) or the Remove all locks from remote client option (for remote locks) appears in the row. Click the appropriate option to remove the lock. remove all locks for the process, or remove all locks from the remote client. If a lock you are removing is part of an open transaction, you are warned before confirming the removal.

In most cases, the only time you need to remove locks is as a result of an application problem.

For a more in-depth description of the LOCK command and its features, see LOCK.

You may need to enlarge the size of the lock table if your system uses a large number of locks. You can do this using the
Management Portal; for instructions, see locksiz.

For more detailed information and alternative ways to manage locks, see Managing the Lock Table.

### 1.4 Monitoring InterSystems IRIS Logs

InterSystems IRIS provides the following logs for monitoring various aspects of its operation:

- Several log files are a vailable in the install-dir\mgr directory; two can be viewed using the Management Portal.

- You can view the application error log or driver error log using the Management Portal

- The contents of the InterSystems IRIS system error log, or syslog, can be reviewed using one of several methods.

As an alternative, you can enable structured logging, which will write the same messages seen in messages.log to a machinereadable file that can be ingested by your choice of monitoring tool. See Setting Up Structured Logging. If you are using a monitoring tool which is compatible with OpenTelemetry, you can also configure InterSystems IRIS to transmit the events seen in messages.log as OTLP/HTTP signals.

#### 1.4.1 Log Files in the install-dir\mgr Directory

The following log files are a vailable in the install-dir\mgr directory. They are saved as plain text files and can be vie wed using any text editor or viewer. The messages log and System Monitor log can be viewed using the Management Portal.

alerts log

Log Monitor scans the messages log at regular intervals for entries of the configured minimum se verity and generates corresponding notifications, which it writes to the alerts log,
Monitor can be configured to send email notifications instead; see Using Log Monitor.

install-dir\mgr\alerts.log, by default. Log

initialization log

The initialization log, iboot.log, contains information about the initialization of the InterSystems IRIS instance.

journal history log

The journal history log, journal.log, contains a list of all journal files maintained by the InterSystems IRIS instance and is used by all journal-related functions, utilities, and APIs to locate journal files. See Journaling.

messages log

InterSystems IRIS reports a variety of messages to the messages log file ( messages.log), including: general mes-
sages; startup/shutdown, license, and network errors; certain operating system errors; and the success or failure
of jobs started remotely from other systems. System Monitor also writes notifications to the messages log. The directory for messages.log can be configured (see console), but the default location is install-dir\mgr.

On Windows-based platforms, all console messages are sent to the messages log file, messages.log. On UNIX®/Linux platforms, you can configure console messages to be sent to the messages log file, the console terminal, or both.

The size of the messages.log file is monitored by System Monitor . The file gro ws until it reaches the configured maximum size, at which point InterSystems IRIS saves the file and starts a ne w one. See MaxConsoleLogSize for information about configuring the maximum messages log size.

Monitoring InterSystems IRIS Logs

You can view the messages log from the View Messages Log page of the Management Portal (System Operation > System Logs > Messages Log). If the messages log is larger than 1 MB, only the most recent 1 MB portion is displayed by the Management Portal. Click the Show entire file link to display the entire file, which may require some time if the file is v ery large.

Note:

If you have trouble starting InterSystems IRIS, use any text editor or text viewer to view the messages log.

System Monitor log

Status messages about the functioning of System Monitor (see Using System Monitor) are written to the System Monitor log, install-dir\mgr\SystemMonitor.log.

The size of the SystemMonitor.log file is monitored by System Monitor . The file gro ws until it reaches the maximum size of 5 MB, at which point it is renamed to SystemMonitor.log.old, overwriting any existing SystemMonitor.log.old file, and a ne w SystemMonitor.log is created. The maximum number of megabytes used by the System Monitor log is therefore 10 MB.

You can view the messages log from the System Monitor Log page of the Management Portal (System Operation > System Logs > System Monitor Log). If the System Monitor log is larger than 1 MB, only the most recent 1 MB portion is displayed by the Management Portal. Click the Show entire file link to display the entire file, which may require some time if the file is v ery large.

#### 1.4.2 Application and Database Driver Error Logs

The View Application Error Log page (System Operation > System Logs > Application Error Log) allows you to view application errors.

Likewise, the xDBC Error Log page (System Operation > System Logs > xDBC Error Log) allows you to view database driver errors.

#### 1.4.3 InterSystems IRIS System Error Log

InterSystems IRIS sets aside a small portion of its shared memory to log items of interest. This table, which can contain important diagnostic information, is referred to by several different names, including the InterSystems IRIS system error log, errlog, SYSLOG, and the syslog table.

By default, the system error log contains the 500 most recent log items. For information about configuring the number of items in the system error log, see errlog.

To view the system error log, choose one of the following methods:

- Open the Terminal, enter set $namespace = "%SYS" to switch to the %SYS namespace, and enter do ^SYSLOG.
You can also enter do FILTER^SYSLOG, which has options to limit the output based on specific error codes or process ID.

- Run a diagnostic report, as described in Using the Diagnostic Report.

- Run the irisstat command with the –e1 option, as described in Running irisstat with Options.

- Run the IRISHung script, as described in IRISHung Script.

You can configure InterSystems IRIS to write the system error log to the messages log during shutdown using the Shut- DownLogErrors setting (see ShutDownLogErrors).

InterSystems provides a mechanism to run a Diagnostic Report on your InterSystems IRIS® data platform instance. The Diagnostic Report is a snapshot of information about an instance that should be run and sent to the InterSystems Worldwide Response Center (WRC) to help diagnose system problems. For more details on the type of information collected, see the Diagnostic Report Contents section.

This topic describes how to configure and run the Diagnostic Report as a task from the Management Portal. F or more information on this task, see the %SYS.Task.DiagnosticReport entry in the InterSystems Class Reference.

### 2.1 Running the Diagnostic Report Task

The most direct way to generate the report is by going to the Diagnostic Report page (System Operation > Diagnostic Reports) of the Management Portal and entering the appropriate information for the Diagnostic Report task. You can edit this information at any time by returning to this page. If you do not wish to edit any of the fields, click Run to generate the report using the current settings.

If you do not enter any information and click Run, the task generates a detailed report and places it in the manager’s directory of the InterSystems IRIS instance (install-dir\mgr) as an HTML file. The file name is in CustomerNameYYYYMMDDHHMM.html format.

For example, on September 24, 2024 at 8:46 p.m., running the Diagnostic Report task with a license key issued to
MyCompany on an instance installed in C:\MyInstallDir generates the following report file:

C:\MyInstallDir\mgr\MyCompany202409242046.html

There are several fields on the page you can set that af fect when the task runs, where the file is sa ved, and whether or not to send the file to the WRC. Configuring Diagnostic Report Settings describes these settings. If you click Close, your changes are discarded and the report task does not run.

Running the Diagnostic Report from the Terminal

You can run the diagnostic report from an InterSystems IRIS terminal, in the %SYS namespace, in the following ways:

%SYS>do ^SystemCheck

Runs the diagnostic report via a command-line interface.

%SYS>do DoAdvanced^SystemCheck

Runs the diagnotic report without the CLI, using the defaults.

Note:

Running the diagnostic report using either of these methods will take several minutes.

Viewing the Diagnostic Report Task History

Click Task History at the top of the Diagnostic Report page to display the history for the Diagnostic Report task. (See Using the Task Manager for information about tasks and task history.)

### 2.2 Configuring Diagnostic Report Settings

The InterSystems IRIS installation contains a predefined on-demand Diagnostic Report task. The first time you go to the Diagnostic Report page, fill in the pertinent information to update the settings for this task. Depending on which fields you
enter, you have the following choices of what to do with the Diagnostic Report:

1. To save the report to a specific archi ve directory other than the manager’s directory, enter a directory name.

2. To send the report to the WRC, enter information in the outgoing mail fields.

3. To both save and send the report, enter the information from the two previous options.

4. To run the report automatically on a regular schedule, enable WRC HealthCheck.

The following list contains the settings for the Diagnostic Report and a description of each:

- Directory for archived reports — location to store the reports. Defaults to the manager’s directory, install-dir\mgr, if you do not enter any information on the page. If you leave this setting blank and enter outgoing mail settings the report is not saved in the manager’s directory. Click Browse to select an existing directory.

Information required to send the report directly to the WRC — if you enter the outgoing mail settings, the report is sent to
WRCHealthCheck@InterSystems.com.

- Existing WRC issue number — WRC problem number (6 digits) related to this run of the Diagnostic Report. To enter a new problem, contact the WRC or enter your problem into WRC Direct.

- The task runs with the WRC issue number only once and then clears this setting.

- Name of IP address of server for outgoing mail — address of your outgoing SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) mail server.

- Username for authenticated SMTP and Password — only required for SMTP authentication with the SMTP server. See RFC 2554 for details.

- Address for the “From:” field in outgoing mail — email address to appear in the sender field. Required if you enter
SMTP server information; defaults to DefaultDiagnosticReport@InterSystems.com.

- Address for the “Reply-To:” field in outgoing mail — a valid email address at your company able to receive automated configuration messages from InterSystems.

- Addresses for the “CC:” field in outgoing mail — additional email addresses to receive the report.

- Enable automatic WRC HealthCheck updates — select this check box to send periodic reports to the WRC. InterSystems highly recommends that you enable the WRC HealthCheck feature. If selected, the Diagnostic Report task runs at regular intervals and sends the report to the WRC. These regular reports allow the WRC to better assist you. Selecting this feature requires you to enter the SMTP server information.

Important:

The report includes private application information. InterSystems keeps all data strictly confidential.

Run the automatic WRC HealthCheck updates every number of days at this time — if you enable WRC HealthCheck, the task manager saves the frequency (defaults to 7 days) and time (defaults to the InterSystems IRIS installation time) information for when to run the Diagnostic Report.

Additional information for the WRC:

- Primary purpose of this instance — choose whether you use this instance of InterSystems IRIS for development, testing, quality assurance, or production.

- Any Ad Hoc content applied that is not in $ZV — enter ad hoc content you have applied that does not appear in the
$ZVersion special variable.

- The type and number of CPUs present

- The total amount of physical memory — enter the amount of physical memory on the machine.

- Other details of the hardware this system uses

- Method used to back up this system (InterSystems, OS, External, other) — enter the methods you use to back up your system.

- Other relevant information about this instance — enter any special notes you want to include with the report.

The Diagnostic Report task retains the information you enter in all but one of the settings; the task runs with the WRC issue
number only once and then clears it. You cannot edit task settings while the report is running.

### 2.3 Diagnostic Report Contents

When the Diagnostic Report task runs, it creates an HTML log file containing both basic and adv anced information, which
is used by the WRC to resolve issues. The following sections describe the sections of the report:

Log Monitor monitors the InterSystems IRIS® data platform instance’s messages log for errors and traps reported by
InterSystems IRIS daemons and user processes; and generates corresponding notifications, including email if configured.
You can manage Log Monitor using the ^MONMGR utility.

### 3.1 System Monitoring Tools

InterSystems IRIS provides three sets of tools for general monitoring of InterSystems IRIS instances, as follows:

- The Management Portal provides several pages and log files that let you monitor a v ariety of system indicators, system performance, InterSystems IRIS locks, and errors and traps, as described in Monitoring InterSystems IRIS Using the Management Portal. Of these, the messages log is the most comprehensive, containing general messages, startup/shutdown, license, and network errors, certain operating system errors, and indicators of the success or failure of jobs started remotely from other systems, as well as alerts, warnings and messages from System Monitor.

- Log Monitor, as described in this topic, generates notifications for messages log entries of a configured minimum severity and either writes them to the alerts log or emails them to specified recipients. This allows messages log alerts of all types to be extracted and brought to the attention of system operators. You can configure Log Monitor using the ^MONMGR utility.

- System Monitor generates alerts and warnings related to important system status and resource usage indicators and also incorporates Application Monitor and Health Monitor, which monitor system and user-defined metrics and generate alerts and warnings when abnormal values are encountered. System Monitor and Health Monitor alerts and warnings
are written to the messages log; Application Monitor alerts can be sent by email or passed to a specified notification
method. You can manage System Monitor (including Application Monitor and Health Monitor) using the ^%SYSMONMGR utility. See System Monitor.

### 3.2 Log Monitor Overview

Log Monitor scans the messages log at regular intervals for entries of the configured se verity level and generates corresponding notifications. These notifications are either written to the alerts log or sent by email to specified recipients.

The messages log contains useful information about the InterSystems IRIS instance, ranging from general messages to errors and traps to System Monitor alerts and warnings. By generating notifications based on messages log contents, Log Monitor raises the visibility of alerts for system operators.

Note:

Log Monitor does not generate a notification for e very messages log entry of the configured se verity. When there is a series of entries from a given process within less than about an hour of each other, a notification is generated for the first entry only . For this reason, you should immediately consult the messages log (and view System Monitor alerts, if applicable) on receiving a single notification from Log Monitor . However, the messages log entries listed in Log Monitor Errors and Traps always generate notifications.

Log Monitor operates with the following settings by default:

- Log Monitor is continuously running when the instance is running.

- The messages log is scanned every 10 seconds.

- Notifications are generated for messages log entries of se verity 2 (severe) and 3 (fatal).

- Notifications are written to the alerts log.

Note:

Log Monitor creates the alerts log the first time it generates a notification. The alerts log, or alerts.log, is located in the<install-dir>/mgr directory.

You can configure Log Monitor using the interacti ve ^MONMGR utility, described in the following section.

### 3.3 Configuring the Log Monitor

The Log Monitor Manager utility, ^MONMGR, allows you to configure and manage Log Manager . You can stop and start Log Monitor, change the default settings, and configure email notifications.

- Introduction to System Monitor Tools

- System Monitor is a fle xible, user-extensible utility used to monitor an InterSystems IRIS® data platform instance and generate notifications when the v alues of one or more of a wide range of metrics indicate a potential problem.

- 4.1 About System Monitor

- System Monitor tools include the following monitoring tools:

- System Monitor monitors system status and resources, generating notifications (alerts and w arnings) based on fix ed parameters and tracking overall system health.

- Health Monitor samples key system and user-defined metrics and compares them to user -configurable parameters and established normal values, generating notifications when samples e xceed applicable thresholds.

- Application Monitor samples significant system metrics, stores the v alues in the local namespace, and evaluates them using user-created alert definitions. When an alert is triggered, it can either generate an email notification or call a specified class method.

- All three tools run in the %SYS namespace by default. Other than Health Monitor, you can run these tools in other namespaces under namespace-specific configurations and settings. You can define and configure your o wn components to extend the capabilities of System Monitor in each namespace as your needs require.

- 4.2 See Also

- Manage Email Options (information about generating email messages from notifications in the messages log, including

- those generated by System Monitor)

- Monitoring Log Files (includes information on the log files generated by this tool)

- System Monitor samples important system status and resource usage indicators, such as the status of ECP connections and the percentage of the lock table in use, and generates notifications—alerts, w arnings, and “status OK” messages—based on fix ed statuses and thresholds. These notifications are written to the messages log, allo wing Log Monitor to generate email messages from them if configured to do so. System Monitor also maintains a single o verall system health state.

- System Monitor is managed using the ^%SYSMONMGR utility.

- System Monitor is part of the System Monitor tools.

### 5.1 The System Monitor Process

In each namespace in which it is configured to run, System Monitor g athers and delivers system metric information in three stages using three types of classes (or System Monitor components). Sensor classes collect information, subscriber classes evaluate the information to form notifications, and notifier classes post the notifications to the proper alerting systems. The
following describes the sequence in greater depth:

1. Obtain metric information

Sensor classes incorporate methods for obtaining the values of system or application metrics. For example, the system sensor class SYS.Monitor.SystemSensors includes the GetProcessCount() method, which returns the number of active processes for the InterSystems IRIS instance, and the GetLockTable() method, which returns the percentage of the instance’s lock table that is in use.

At a fix ed interval, System Monitor calls the GetSensors() method of each configured sensor class. A sensor class
may do one of the following:

- Return an array of sensor name/value pairs to be passed by System Monitor to subscriber classes (described in stage 2)

- Evaluate the sensor values it obtains and return notifications to be posted by System monitor to notifier classes (described in stage 3) One of the sensor classes provided with System Monitor, SYS.Monitor.SystemSensors, returns a name/value array. The other, %SYS.Monitor.AppMonSensor, performs its own evaluations and generates its own notifications.

2. Evaluate metric information

Subscriber classes incorporate methods for evaluating sensor values and generating notifications. After calling each sensor class that returns a name/value array, System Monitor calls the Receive() method of each subscriber class, populating the SensorReading property with the array. For each sensor name/value pair provided to its Receive()

method, the subscriber class evaluates the value and if appropriate returns a notification containing te xt and a severity code.

For example, when System Monitor passes the name/value array returned from SYS.Monitor.SystemSensors.GetSensors()
to subscriber classes:

- the system subscriber, SYS.Monitor.SystemSubscriber, may discover that the LockTablePercentFull value is over 85, its warning threshold for that sensor, and return a notification containing a se verity code of 1 and appropriate text.

- the Health Monitor subscriber, SYS.Monitor.Health.Control, may determine that the ProcessCount value is too high, based on that sensor’s configured parameters and established normal v alues, and return a notification containing a severity code of 2 and appropriate text.

3. Generate notifications

Notifier classes incorporate methods for passing notifications to one or more alerting systems. After calling each sensor class and subscriber class, System Monitor calls the Post() method of each notifier class, populating the Notifications property with the notifications returned by sensor or subscriber classes. The notifier class then passes each notification
to the desired alerting method; for example, when the system notifier recei ves the notifications returned by the system
subscriber for LockTablePercentFull and the Health Monitor subscriber for ProcessCount, it writes the severity code and text to the messages log. This approach allows notifications to be passed to independent alerting systems such as the interoperability production alert processors and those in TrakCare, as well as user-defined alerting systems.

System Monitor starts automatically when the instance starts and begins calling the configured sensor classes in each of the configured startup namespaces, passing sensor v alues to configured subscriber classes and notifications to configured notifier classes in turn. You can define and configure your own System Monitor sensor, subscriber and notifier classes on a per-namespace basis. See the default classes in Default System Monitor Components.

Note:

In an emergency, System Monitor may need to be shut down. The class method %SYS.Monitor.Enabled([fla g]) sets, clears, and reports the status of System Monitor. If fla g is 0, System Monitor will not start.

### 5.2 Tracking System Monitor Notifications

Typically, any System Monitor alert (notification of se verity 2) or sequence of System Monitor warnings (severity 1) should be investigated. Health Monitor can also generate System Monitor alerts and warnings.

System Monitor alerts, warnings, and status messages (severity 0) are written to the messages log (install-dir\mgr\messages.log). (All System Monitor and Health Monitor status messages are written to the System Monitor log, install-dir\mgr\SystemMonitor.log. Application Monitor alerts are not written to logs, but can be sent by email or passed to a specified notification method.)

To track System Monitor alerts and warnings, you can do the following:

- View System Monitor alerts using the ^%SYSMONMGR utility. This option lets you display alerts for all sensors or for a specific sensor and vie w all recorded alerts or only those occurring during a specified time period, b ut it does not display warnings.

- Monitor the messages log (see Monitoring Log Files). Bear in mind that when a sequence of System Monitor alerts is generated for a given sensor within a short period of time, only the first is written to the messages log.

Note:

In the messages log, System Monitor status notifications are labeled with initial capitals, for e xample [System Monitor] started in %SYS, whereas warnings, alerts and OK messages are labeled in uppercase, such as [SYSTEM MONITOR] CPUusage Warning: CPUusage = 90 ( Warnvalue is 85).

System Monitor Status and Resource Metrics

- Configure Log Monitor to send email notifications of alerts (and optionally w arnings) appearing in the messages log (instead of writing them to the alerts log, the default). When relying on this method, keep in mind that Log Monitor
does not generate a notification for e very messages log entry of the configured se verity; when there is a series of entries
from a given process (such as System Monitor) within about one hour, a notification is generated for the first entry only. For example, if a network problem causes multiple System Monitor alerts concerning ECP connections and open transactions to be generated over a 15 minute period, Log Monitor generates only one notification (for whiche ver alert was first). F or this reason, on receiving a single System Monitor notification from Log Monitor you should immediately view System Monitor alerts and consult the messages log.

### 5.3 System Monitor Status and Resource Metrics

The following table lists the system status and resource usage metrics sampled by System Monitor, and the notification thresholds and rules for each that result in warnings (severity 1), alerts (severity 2), and “status OK” (severity 0) notifications.

### 5.4 System Monitor Health State

Based on notifications posted to the messages log (see Monitoring Log Files), including both system alerts generated directly by the InterSystems IRIS instance and alerts and warnings generated by System Monitor and its Health Monitor component, System Monitor maintains a single value summarizing overall system health in a register in shared memory.

At startup, the system health state is set based on the number of system (not System Monitor) alerts posted to the messages log during the startup process. Once System Monitor is running, the health state can be elevated by either system alerts or System Monitor alerts or warnings. Status is cleared to the next lower level when 30 minutes have elapsed since the last system alert or System Monitor alert or warning was posted. The following table shows how the system health state is determined.

System Monitor Health State

Table 5–2: System Monitor Health State

n/a

state is GREEN and

YELLOW (1)

up to four system alerts are posted during startup

RED (2)

five or more system alerts are posted during startup

- one system alert is posted

- OR

- one or more System Monitor alerts and/or warnings are posted, but not alerts sufficient to set RED, as below

- state is YELLOW and one system alert is posted

OR

state is GREEN or YELLOW and during a 30 minute period, System Monitor alerts from at least five different sensors or three System Monitor alerts from a single sensor are posted

GREEN when 30 minutes have elapsed since the last system alert or System Monitor alert or warning was posted

YELLOW when 30 minutes have elapsed since the last system alert or System Monitor alert or warning was posted

Note:

A fourth state, HUNG, can occur when global updates are blocked. Specifically , the following events change the
state to HUNG:

- The journal daemon is paused for more than 5 seconds or frozen (see Journal I/O Errors).

- Any of switches 10, 11, 13, or 14 are set (see Using Switches).

- The write daemon is stopped for any reason or sets the updates locked flag for more than 3 seconds.

- The number of available global buffers (in the database cache) falls into the critical region and remains there for more than 5 seconds.

When the health state changes to HUNG, the reason is written to the messages log.

You can view the System Monitor health state using:

- The View System Health option on the View System Data menu of ^%SYSMONMGR (which does not report HUNG).

- The $SYSTEM.Monitor API, which lets you access the system status directly. Use $SYSTEM.Monitor.State() to return
the system status; see also the SetState, Clear, Alert, GetAlerts, and ClearAlerts methods.

- The iris list and iris qlist commands (which do not include health state on Windows).

Note: When System Monitor is not running, the System Monitor health state is always GREEN.

### 5.5 System Monitor Defaults

System Monitor calls a provided set of classes that can be augmented, runs in the %SYS namespace, and operates under three default settings that can be changed.

#### 5.5.1 Default System Monitor Components

Five classes are provided with InterSystems IRIS and configured in System Monitor in the %SYS namespace by default.

Sensor classes:

- SYS.Monitor.SystemSensors System sensor class obtaining sensor values to be passed to configured subscriber classes, including the System Monitor subscriber (SYS.Monitor.SystemSubscriber) and Health Monitor subscriber (SYS.Monitor.Health.Control).

- %SYS.Monitor.AppMonSensor

Class providing sensor, subscriber and notification services for Application Monitor; obtains sensor values and stores
them in the local namespace, evaluates the values based on user-defined alerts and either generates an email message or calls a user-specified method when an alert is triggered, based on the alert definition.

Subscriber classes:

- SYS.Monitor.Health.Control

- Subscriber class for Health Monitor; receives and evaluates statistical sensor values from SYS.Monitor.SystemSensors
and posts notifications to the system notifier

.

SYS.Monitor.SystemSubscriber

System Monitor subscriber available to all sensor classes; contains all code required to monitor and analyze the sensors
in SYS.Monitor.SystemSensors. Generates System Monitor notifications and Health Monitor notifications for some sensors.

Notifier class:

- SYS.Monitor.SystemNotify System notifier a vailable to all subscriber classes. On receiving a notification from the system subscriber (SYS.Monitor.SystemSubscriber) or Health Monitor subscriber (SYS.Monitor.Health.Control), writes it to the System Monitor log, and to the messages log if it is of severity 2 (alert). (See Monitoring InterSystems IRIS Using the Management Portal for information on these log files.) The system notifier also generates a single o verall evaluation of system status that can be obtained using the SYS.Monitor.State() method, which returns 0 (GREEN), 1 (YELLOW), or 2 (RED).

User-defined classes can be configured using ^%SYSMONMGR.

#### 5.5.2 Default System Monitor Namespace

All System Monitor and Application Monitor configurations and settings are namespace-specific. By def Monitor starts and runs only in the %SYS namespace. Additional startup namespaces for System Monitor and Application Monitor can be configured using ^%SYSMONMGR. Following any change you make to the System Monitor or Application Monitor configuration for a namespace, you must restart System Monitor in the namespace for the change to take effect.

ault, System

Health Monitor runs only in the %SYS namespace.

#### 5.5.3 Default System Monitor Settings

By default, the System Monitor is always running when the instance is running; it can be stopped using ^%SYSMONMGR
but will start automatically again when the instance next starts.

By default, the System Monitor:

- calls the GetSensors() method of each configured sensor class e very 30 seconds.

- writes only alerts, warnings and messages to the System Monitor log, and does not write sensor readings.

- does not save sensor readings.

These settings can be changed using ^%SYSMONMGR.

### 5.6 Using the ^%SYSMONMGR Utility

The ^%SYSMONMGR utility lets you manage and configure the System Monitor . The utility can be executed in any namespace, and changes made with it affect only the namespace in which it is started. You must maintain a separate System Monitor configuration for each startup namespace you configure by e Following any change you make to the System Monitor configuration for a namespace, you must restart System Monitor in the namespace for the change to take effect.

xecuting ^%SYSMONMGR in that namespace.

Important:

All manual operations using the ^%SYSMONMGR utility described in this section can be executed programatically using the methods in the %Monitor.Manager API.

To manage the System Monitor, enter the following command in the Terminal:

do ^%SYSMONMGR

The main menu appears.

1) Start/Stop System Monitor 2) Set System Monitor Options 3) Configure System Monitor Classes 4) View System Monitor State 5) Manage Application Monitor 6) Manage Health Monitor 7) View System Data 8) Exit

Option?

Enter the number of your choice or press Enter to exit the utility.

The options in the main menu let you perform System Monitor tasks as described in the following table:

- Display the Application Monitor submenu

- Display the Health Monitor submenu (available only if ^%SYSMONMGR is run in the %SYS namespace)

- View saved sensor readings

- View the System Monitor health state

- View past or current System Monitor alerts

#### 5.6.1 Start/Stop System Monitor

When an InterSystems IRIS instance starts, System Monitor starts automatically and begins calling configured classes in
each configured startup namespace; this cannot be changed. While the instance is running, however, you can stop System
Monitor, and must do so in order to change the configuration of Health Monitor . In addition, following any change you make to the System Monitor configuration for a namespace, you must restart System Monitor in the namespace for the change to take effect.

When you enter 1 at the main menu, the following menu is displayed:

1) Start System Monitor 2) Stop System Monitor 3) Exit

Enter 2 to stop System Monitor when it is running, and 1 to start it when it is stopped.

Note:

System Monitor monitors the size of the messages log and rolls it over when required. When System Monitor is stopped, the messages log may exceed the limit set by the MaxConsoleLogSize configuration setting until the instance is restarted or the PurgeErrorsAndLogs task is run. See Monitoring Log Filesfor information about the messages log.

#### 5.6.2 Set System Monitor Options

To change global System Monitor settings or to return them to their default values, stop System Monitor if it is running
and then enter 2 at the main menu:

2) Set Debugging Level 3) Reset Defaults 4) Manage Debug Data 5) Exit

Enter 1 to set the interval at which System Monitor calls each configured sensor class; the def ault is 30 seconds.

Enter 2 to set the debugging level. The default is 0 (base) which writes System Monitor and Health monitor status and error messages to the System Monitor log, and does not save sensor readings. Debugging level 1 (log all sensors) writes sensor readings to the System Monitor log along with messages and saves sensor readings, which can then be viewed using the View Sensor Data option of the View System Data menu.

Enter 3 to reset the sample interval, debugging level, and saving of sensor readings to their default values.

Enter 4 to set the number of days for which sensor readings are saved; the default is 5.

Your changes take effect when you next start or restart System Monitor.

#### 5.6.3 Configure System Monitor Components

As described in System Monitor, you can create your own sensor, subscriber and notifier classes by e xtending %SYS.Monitor.AbstractSensor, %SYS.Monitor.AbstractSubscriber, and %SYS.Monitor.AbstractNotification, respectively, and configure them in System Monitor to e xtend the capabilities of the provided classes described in Default System Monitor Components. You can also add namespaces other than %SYS for System Monitor to start and run in.

##### 5.6.3.1 Configure System Monitor Classes

When you enter 3 at the main menu, the following menu is displayed:

1) Configure Components 2) Configure Startup Namespaces 3) Exit

Enter 1 to display the options for configuring classes:

1) List Classes 2) Add Class 3) Delete Class 4) Exit

Enter 1 to list the currently configured classes for the namespace in which you started ^%SYSMONMGR, including provided system classes and those you have configured.

Enter 2 to configure a user -defined class for the namespace in which you started ^%SYSMONMGR. The class you specify must exist in the namespace and be recognized by System Monitor as a valid sensor, subscriber or notifier class. You can also enter a description of the class.

Enter 3 to delete a user-defined class you ha ve configured.

Note:

Configuring or deleting a class af fects only the namespace in which you started ^%SYSMONMGR.

##### 5.6.3.2 Configure System Monitor Namespaces

When an instance starts, System Monitor automatically starts as a separate process in each configured startup namespace (by default %SYS only). All System Monitor configurations and settings are namespace-specific. When you make changes using ^%SYSMONMGR, the changes affect only the namespace in which you started the utility.

Note:

All instances of ^%SYSMONMGR write messages to the same System Monitor log. Startup namespaces can be configured from an y namespace.

When you enter 3 at the main menu, the following menu is displayed:

1) Configure Components 2) Configure Startup Namespaces 3) Exit

Enter 2 to display the options for configuring namespaces:

1) List Startup Namespaces 2) Add Namespace 3) Delete Namespace 4) Exit

Enter 1 to list the currently configured startup namespaces.

Enter 2 to add a startup namespace.

Enter 3 to delete a startup namespace. (You cannot delete %SYS.)

#### 5.6.4 View System Monitor State

Enter 4 at the main menu to display the status of System Monitor and its components in the namespace in which you started
^%SYSMONMGR, for example:

Component State
System Monitor OK
%SYS.Monitor.AppMonSensor None
SYS.Monitor.SystemSensors OK
SYS.Monitor.Health.Control Running: Period is Thursday 09:00 - 11:30
SYS.Monitor.SystemSubscriber OK
SYS.Monitor.SystemNotifier OK

In this example, System Monitor and its system sensor, subscriber and notifier classes are running normally , as is Health Monitor’s subscriber class. However, none of Application Monitor’s classes are activated (see Manage Monitor Classes), so it is not evaluating sensor samples or generating alerts.

#### 5.6.5 Manage Application Monitor

See Using ^%SYSMONMGR to Manage Application Monitor.

#### 5.6.6 Manage Health Monitor

See Using ^%SYSMONMGR to Manage Health Monitor.

Defining System Monitor Components

#### 5.6.7 View System Data

Enter 7 at the main menu (or 6 in namespaces other than %SYS) to display options for viewing System Monitor information about the system.

1) View Sensor Data 2) View System Health 3) View Alerts 4) Exit

Enter 1 to view saved sensor readings, if you have enabled saving of sensor data using the Manage Debug Data option on the Set System Monitor Options menu. You can display saved readings for all sensors or for a specific sensor , and you can view all saved sensor readings or only those for a time period you specify.

Enter 2 to view the System Monitor health state, including all alerts between the previous GREEN state and the current state, if not GREEN.

Enter 3 to view System Monitor alerts. You can display alerts for all sensors or for a specific sensor , and you can view all alerts within the period you specified using the Manage Debug Data option on the Set System Monitor Options menu, or only those for a time period you specify.

### 5.7 Defining System Monitor Components

The SYS.Monitor API lets define your o wn sensor, subscriber, and notifier classes.

#### 5.7.1 Sensor Classes

Sensor classes extend %SYS.Monitor.AbstractSensor. The System Monitor controller initially calls each sensor class’s
Start() method; thereafter, on each cycle, it calls the GetSensors() method. The SetSensor() method is used within the
sensor class to set sensor name/value pairs in the SensorReading property, which is returned by GetSensors() and passed to all subscriber classes.

A sensor class may also evaluate sensor readings and, as a result of its evaluation, call the %SYS.Monitor.Email class for generating email messages from notifications or an y user-defined alerting method.

#### 5.7.2 Subscriber Classes

Subscriber classes extend %SYS.Monitor.AbstractSubscriber. The System Monitor controller initially calls each subscriber
class’s Start() method; thereafter, on each cycle, it calls the Receive() method once for each sensor class called in the cycle,
passing the SensorReading property with the sensor name/value pairs received from that sensor class. The subscriber class may evaluate one or more of the name/value pairs and set notifications using the Notify() method, which populates the Notifications property.

A subscriber class may also, as a result of its sensor evaluation, call the %SYS.Monitor.Email class for generating email messages from notifications, or an y user-defined alerting method.

%SYS.Monitor.SampleSubscriber is provided as a sample subscriber class.

#### 5.7.3 Notifier Classes

Notifier classes e xtend %SYS.Monitor.AbstractNotification. The System Monitor controller initially calls each notifier class’ s
Start() method; thereafter, on each cycle, it calls the Post() method once for each subscriber class called in the cycle,
passing the Notifications property with the notifications recei ved from that subscriber. The notifier class calls then passes

the notifications to its alerting method(s), which may include the %SYS.Monitor.Email class for generating email messages from notifications or an y user-defined alerting method.

### 5.8 See Also

- Manage Email Options (information about generating email messages from notifications in the messages log, including

- those generated by System Monitor)

- Monitoring Log Files (includes information on the log files generated by this tool)

- Health Monitor monitors a running InterSystems IRIS instance by sampling the values of a broad set of key metrics during specific periods and comparing them to configured parameters for the metric and established normal v
alues for those periods;
if sampled values are too high, Health Monitor generates an alert (notification of se verity 2) or warning (severity 1). For example, if CPU usage values sampled by Health Monitor at 10:15 AM on a Monday are too high based on the configured maximum value for CPU usage or normal CPU usage samples taken during the Monday 9:00 AM to 11:30 AM period, Health Monitor generates a notification.

- Health Monitor is part of the System Monitor tools.

### 6.1 Health Monitor Overview

Health Monitor uses a fix ed set of rules to evaluate sampled values and identify those that are abnormally high. This design is based on the approach to monitoring manufacturing processes described in the “Process or Product Monitoring and Control” section of the NIST/SEMATECH e-Handbook of Statistical Methods, with deviation from normal values determined using rules based on the WECO statistical probability rules (Western Electric Rules), both adapted specifically for InterSystems IRIS monitoring purposes.

Health Monitor alerts (severity 2) and warnings (severity 1) are written to the messages log (install-dir\mgr\messages.log). See Tracking System Monitor Notifications for information about ways to make sure you are aware of these notifications.

Health Monitor status messages (severity 0) are written to the System Monitor log (install-dir\mgr\SystemMonitor.log).

Note:

Unlike System Monitor and Application Monitor, Health Monitor runs only in the %SYS namespace.

The following subsections describe how Health Monitor works and contain information about configuring and e xtending
it in various ways:

- Health Monitor Process Description

- Sensors and Sensor Objects

- 6.1.1 Health Monitor Process Description

- By default, Health Monitor does not start automatically when the instance starts; for this to happen, you must enable Health
Monitor within System Monitor using the ^%SYSMONMGR utility. (You can specify an interval to wait after InterSystems IRIS starts before starting Health Monitor when it is enabled, allowing the instance to reach normal operating conditions before sampling begins.) You can always use the utility to see the current status of Health Monitor. For more information, see Using ^%SYSMONMGR to Manage Health Monitor.

- The basic elements of the Health Monitor process are described in the following:

- Health Monitor monitors a number of system sensors, which are represented as sensor objects. Every sensor object has a base (minimum) value for sensor samples, and optionally includes two notification threshold v alues (one for alerts, and the other for warnings) which can be set as absolute values or multipliers. These values determine when Health Monitor sends notifications.

- Sensors and Sensor Objects lists all the sensor objects.

- For the duration of a predefined period, each sensor is sampled every 30 seconds; samples below the base value are
discarded. By default there are 63 weekly periods (nine per day), but you can configure your o wn weekly, monthly, quarterly, or yearly periods. Periods lists the default periods.

- For a given sensor, unless the notification thresholds are set as absolute v alues, Health Monitor evaluates the sensor readings based on a chart. If the necessary chart for the current period does not exist, Health Monitor places the sensor in analysis mode to generate the chart.

You can edit or create a chart to calibrate how Health Monitor evaluates sensor readings. For more information, see
Charts.

If a sensor is not in analysis mode, it is in monitoring mode. In monitoring mode, sensor readings are evaluated by the appropriate subscriber class. To ensure that notifications are not triggered by transient abnormal samples, e very six sample values are averaged together to generate one reading every three minutes, and it is these readings that are evaluated.

- When a sequence of readings meets the criteria for a notification (as described in Notification Rules ), the subscriber class generates an alert or a warning by passing a notification containing te xt and a severity code to the system notifier ,
SYS.Monitor.SystemNotify.

Note:

Because no chart is required to evaluate readings from sensors whose sensor objects have maximum and warning values specified, e valuation of these sensor readings and posting of any resulting notifications is handled by the SYS.Monitor.SystemSubscriber subscriber class, rather than the SYS.Monitor.Health.Control subscriber class (see Default System Monitor Components). As a result, notifications for these sensors are generated even when Health Monitor is not enabled, as long as System Monitor is running.

If you want to generate notifications using absolute v alues for some sensors but using multipliers for others—for example, using absolute values for DBLatency sensors for some databases but multipliers for others—you can do so by setting multipliers in the sensor object and manually creating charts for those for which you
want to use absolute values; see Editing a Chart for more information.

#### 6.1.2 Sensors and Sensor Objects

A Health Monitor sensor object represents one of the sensors in SYS.Monitor.SystemSensors. Each sensor object must provide a base value, and can optionally provide a maximum (alert) threshold and a warnings threshold (either as absolute
values or multipliers); see Notification Rules for information about how these values are used in evaluating sensor readings.
The Health Monitor sensor objects are shown with their default parameters in the following table.

Some sensors represent an overall metric for the InterSystems IRIS instance. These are the sensors which, in the following table, have no value listed in the Sensor Item column. For example, the LicensePercentUsed sensor samples the percentage of the instance’s authorized license units that are currently in use, while the JournalGrowthRate sensor samples the amount of data (in KB per minute) written to the instance’s journal files.

Other sensors collect information about a specific sensor item (either a CSP serv er, a database, or a mirror). For example, DBReads sensors sample the number of reads per minute from each mounted database. These sensors are specified as
<sensor_object> <sensor_item>; for example, the DBLatency install-dir\IRIS\mgr\user sensor samples the time (in millisec-
onds) required to complete a random read on the USER database.

Sensor objects can be listed and edited (but not deleted) using the ^%SYSMONMGR utility (as described in Configure Health Monitor Classes). Editing a sensor object allows you to modify one or all of its values. You can enter a base value
only; a base, maximum (alert), and warning value; or a base value, maximum (alert) multiplier, and warning multiplier.

Note:

Some sensors are not sampled for all InterSystems IRIS instances. For example, the ECP... sensors are sampled only on ECP data and application servers.

When you are monitoring a mirror member (see Mirroring), the following special conditions apply to Health
Monitor:

- No sensors are sampled while the mirror is restarting (for example, just after the backup failover member has taken over as primary) or if the member’s status in the mirror is indeterminate.

- If a sensor is in analysis mode for a period and the member’s status in the mirror changes during the period, no chart is created and the sensor remains in analysis mode.

- Only the MirrorDatabaseLatency* and MirrorJournalLatency* sensors are sampled on the backup failover mirror member.

- All sensors except the MirrorDatabaseLatency* and MirrorJournalLatency* sensors are sampled on the primary failover mirror member.

#### 6.1.3 Periods

By default there are 63 recurring weekly periods during which sensors are sampled. Each of these periods represents one
of the following specified interv als during a particular day of the week:

Table 6–2: Default Health Monitor Periods

00:15 a.m. – 02:45 a.m.

03:00 a.m. – 06:00 a.m.

06:15 a.m. – 08:45 a.m.

09:00 a.m. – 11:30 a.m.

11:45 a.m. – 01:15 p.m.

01:30 p.m. – 04:00 p.m.

04:15 p.m. – 06:00 p.m.

06:15 p.m. – 08:45 p.m.

09:00 p.m. – 11:59 p.m.

You can list, add and delete periods using the Configure Periods option in the ^%SYSMONMGR utility (see Configure Health Monitor Classes). You can add monthly, quarterly or yearly periods as well as weekly periods.

Note:

Quarterly periods are listed in three-month increments beginning with the month specified as the start month; for
example, if you specify 5 (May) as the starting month, the quarterly cycle repeats in August (8), November (11) and February (2).

Descriptions are optional for user-defined periods.

#### 6.1.4 Charts

If the notification threshold v alues for a sensor object are not given as multipliers (or not specified), Health Monitor requires a chart to evaluate those sensor readings. Health Monitor generates the necessary charts by calculating the mean, standard deviation, and maximum value from sample sensor readings. This section describes how Health Monitor generates charts in analysis mode, and how to edit or create custom charts.

##### 6.1.4.1 Analysis Mode

Before Health Monitor can evaluate sensor samples, it checks whether that sensor requires a chart. If a chart is required but does not yet exist, Health Monitor automatically puts the sensor in analysis mode.

In analysis mode, Health Monitor simply records the samples it collects, and at the end of the period generates the required chart for the sensor. To ensure that the chart is reliable, a minimum of 13 samples must be taken in analysis mode. Until 13 valid samples are taken within a single recurrence of a period, the sensor remains in analysis mode and no chart is gen- erated for that period.

Note:

Charts should always be generated from samples taken during normal, stable operation of the InterSystems IRIS instance. For example, when a Monday 09:00 a.m. - 11:30 a.m. chart does not exist, it should not be generated on a Monday holiday or while a technical problem is affecting the operation of the InterSystems IRIS instance.

When a period has recurred fiv e times since a chart was generated for a sensor or sensor/item during that period, not including those during which an alert was generated, the readings from these fiv e normal period recurrences are evaluated to detect a rising or shifted mean for the sensor. If the mean is rising or has shifted with 95% certainty, the chart is recalibrated—the existing chart for the sensor during that period is replaced with a chart generated from the samples taken during the most recent recurrence of the period. For example, if the number of users accessing a database is growing slowly but steadily, the mean DBReads value for that database is likely to also rise slowly but steadily, resulting in regular chart recalibration every fiv e periods, which avoids unwarranted alerts.

Note that sensor object absolute and multiplier values cannot be automatically recalibrated in the same way, and should be adjusted manually because automatic chart recalibration does not apply to such sensors. For example, if the number of users accessing a database grows, the base, maximum (alert) value, and warning value for the DBLatency sensor object may require manual adjustment.

##### 6.1.4.2 Editing a Chart

The ^%SYSMONMGR utility lets you display a list of all current charts, including the mean and sigma of each. You can also display the details of a particular chart, including the individual readings and highest reading. To access these options from the utility, select Configure Charts from the Configure Health Monitor Classes submenu .

The Configure Charts option also provides two ways to customize alerting by customizing charts:

- You can change the mean and/or sigma to whatever values you wish by editing an existing chart. The standard notification rules apply, but using the values you have entered.

- You can create a chart, specifying an alert value and a warning value. Creating a chart is similar to setting an absolute
value for the notification threshold; alerts and w arnings are generated based solely on the values you supply for the
chart.

Note: When listing, examining, editing, or creating charts, the Item heading or prompt refers to a database (specified by

a directory path), a Web Gateway server (specified by an IP address), or a mirror (specified by the mirror name). See Sensors and Sensor Objects for more information.

You can also programmatically build chart statistics based on a list of values with the following SYS.Monitor.Health.Chart
class methods:

- CreateChart() — Creates a chart for a specific period/sensor , evaluates the list of values, and sets the resulting mean and sigma values.

- SetChartStats() — Evaluates the list of values and sets the resulting mean and sigma values for a specified period/sensor.

For more information, see the SYS.Monitor.Health.Chart class documentation.

Note:

A chart generated by Health Monitor, including one you have edited, can be automatically recalibrated as described in Analysis Mode. In addition, all charts generated by Health Monitor, including those that have been edited, are deleted when an InterSystems IRIS instance is upgraded.

A chart created using the Configure Charts submenu or the CreateChart() class method, however, is never automatically recalibrated or deleted on upgrade. A user-created chart is therefore permanently associated with the selected sensor/period combination until you select the Reset Charts option within the Reset Defaults option of the Configure Health Monitor Classes submenu or select Recalibrate Charts within the Configure Charts option.

#### 6.1.5 Notification Rules

Health Monitor generates an alert (notification of se verity 2) if three consecutive readings of a sensor during a period are greater than the sensor maximum threshold value, and a warning (notification of se verity 1) if fiv e consecutive readings of a sensor during a period are greater than the sensor warning threshold value. The maximum and warning threshold values depend on the settings in the sensor object and whether the applicable chart was generated by Health Monitor or created by a user, as shown in the following table.

Note also that:

- When a sensor object has maximum value and warning value set, no chart is required and therefore no chart is generated, and notifications are generated e ven when Health Monitor is disabled.

- When a sensor object has maximum multiplier and warning multiplier set, or base only, a chart is required; until sufficient samples have been collected in analysis mode to generate the chart, no notifications are generated.

- When a user-created chart exists, it does not matter what the sensor object settings are.

#### 6.1.6 Examples

In this example, the chart for the DBReads install-dir\IRIS\mgr\user sensor during the Monday 09:00 a.m. - 11:30 a.m. period indicates that the mean reads per minute from the USER database is 2145, with a sigma of 141 and maximum value of 2327. The default notification threshold multipler for DBReads is 2. An alert is generated for this sensor when three
consecutive readings exceed the greater of the following two values:

- maximum multiplier * (chart mean + (3 * chart sigma))

- maximum multiplier * (chart maximum value + chart sigma)) So, or this sensor during this period, an alert is generated if three consecutive readings are greater than 5136.

A sensor with no multipliers or maximum values is evaluated with a multiplier of 1. As an example, if the DBReads sensor object were edited to remove the multipliers, leaving it with only a base, an alert is generated for DBReads
install-dir\IRIS\mgr\user when three consecutive readings are greater than 2568, calculated as the greater of:

- maximum multiplier * (the chart mean + three times the sigma)

- maximum multiplier * (the highest value in the chart + one sigma)

### 6.2 Using ^%SYSMONMGR to Manage Health Monitor

As described in Using the ^%SYSMONMGR Utility, the ^%SYSMONMGR utility lets you manage and configure System Monitor, including Health Monitor. To manage Health Monitor, change to the %SYS namespace in the Terminal, then enter
the following command:

%SYS>do ^%SYSMONMGR

1) Start/Stop System Monitor 2) Set System Monitor Options 3) Configure System Monitor Classes 4) View System Monitor State 5) Manage Application Monitor 6) Manage Health Monitor 7) View System Data 8) Exit

Option?

Note:

Health Monitor runs only in the %SYS namespace. When you start ^%SYSMONMGR in another namespace, option 6 (Manage Health Monitor) does not appear.

Enter 6 for Manage Health Monitor. The following menu displays:

1) Enable/Disable Health Monitor 2) View Alerts Records 3) Configure Health Monitor Classes 4) Set Health Monitor Options 5) Exit

Option?

Using ^%SYSMONMGR to Manage Health Monitor

Enter the number of your choice or press Enter to exit the Health Monitor utility.

The options in the main menu let you perform Health Monitor tasks as described in the following table:

Option

Description

1) Enable/Disable
Health Monitor

2) View Alert
Records

3) Configure Health
Monitor Classes

4) Set Health
Monitor Options

- Enable Health Monitor (if it is disabled, as by default), so that it starts when System Monitor starts. Health Monitor does not begin collecting sensor reading until after the configured startup wait time is complete.

- Disable Health Monitor (if it is enabled), so that it does not start when System Monitor starts.

- View alert records for one or all sensors objects over a specified date range.

- List notification rules.

- List and delete existing periods and add new ones.

- List, examine, edit, create and recalibrate charts.

- List sensor objects and edit their settings.

- Reset Health Monitor elements to their defaults.

- Set startup wait time.

- Specify when alert records should be purged.

Note: When the utility asks you to specify a single element such as a sensor, rule, period or chart, you can enter ? (question mark) at the prompt for a numbered list, then enter the number of the element you want.

All output from the utility can be displayed on the Terminal or sent to a specified de vice.

The following example demonstrates how to modify a sensor using the ^%SYSMONMGR utility, with
MirrorDatabaseLatencyTime as a specific case:

1. Stop the System Monitor
Option 1 - Start/Stop System Monitor Option 2 - Stop System Monitor

2. Edit the MirrorDatabaseLatencyTime settings:
Option 6 - Manage Health Monitor Option 3 - Configure Health Monitor Classes Option 4 - Edit Sensor Objects Option 2 - Edit Sensor Object
Sensor? MirrorDatabaseLatencyTime
Base? 1000 => Enter either an Alert Value or a Multiplier

Alert Value? 5000 => Setting Max Multiplier and Warn Multiplier to 0. Enter a Warn Value

Warn Value? 3000 => Changing these settings (in milliseconds) would alter the alert settings to the new values.

3. Start the System Monitor again.
Option 1 - Start/Stop System Monitor Option 1 - Start System Monitor

#### 6.2.1 View Alerts Records

Choose this option to view recently generated alerts for a specific sensor , or for all sensors. You can examine the details of individual alerts and warnings, including the mean and sigma of the chart and the readings that triggered the notification.
(Alert records are purged after a configurable number of days; see the Set Health Monitor Options for more information.)

#### 6.2.2 Configure Health Monitor Classes

The options in this submenu let you customize Health Monitor, as described in the following table.

Note:

You cannot use these options to customize Health Monitor while System Monitor is running; you must first stop
System Monitor, and then restart it after you have made your changes.

Option

Description

1) Activate/
Deactivate Rules

(not in use in this release)

2) Configure

3) Configure

List the currently configured periods and add and delete periods.

Lets you

- List the mean and sigma of all existing charts, organized by period.

- Examine individual charts in detail, including the readings on which the mean and sigma are based, with the highest reading called out.

- Change the mean and sigma of an existing chart using the Edit Charts option.

- Create a chart, specifying alert and warning thresholds.

- Manually recalibrate all charts (including user-created charts) or an individual chart from the most recent data.

4) Edit Sensor
Objects

List the sensor objects representing the sensors in the SYS.Monitor.SystemSensors class and modify their base, maximum, warning, maximum multiplier, and warning multiplier values.

5) Reset Defaults

Lets you

- Reset to the default period configuration and remove all existing charts, returning every period to analysis mode (see Health Monitor Process Description).

- Remove all existing charts (including user-created charts), returning every period to analysis mode, without removing any user-defined period configuration.

- Reset all sensor objects to their default values.

- Reset the health monitor options (startup wait time and alert purge time) to their defaults

#### 6.2.3 Set Health Monitor Options

This submenu lets you set several Health Monitor options, as shown in the following table:

Option

Description

1) Set Startup
Wait Time

Configure the number of minutes System Monitor waits after starting, when Health Monitor is enabled, before passing sensor readings to the Health Monitor subscriber, SYS.Health.Monitor.Control. This allows InterSystems IRIS to reach normal operating conditions before Health Monitor begins creating charts or evaluating readings.

2) Set Alert Purge
Time

Specify when an alert record should be purged (deleted); the default is five days
after the alert is generated.

- Application Monitor monitors a user-extensible set of metrics, maintains a persistent repository of the data it collects, and triggers user-configured alerts.

Application Monitor is part of the System Monitor tools.

### 7.1 Overview

Application Monitor is an extensible utility that monitors a user-selected set of system- and user-defined metrics in each startup namespace configured in System Monitor . As described in Default System Monitor Components, when %SYS.Monitor.AppMonSensor, the Application Monitor sensor class, is called by System Monitor, it samples metrics, evaluates the samples, and generates its own notifications. (Unlik e System Monitor and Health Monitor notifications, these are not written to the messages log.) Specifically , Application Monitor does the following in each System Monitor startup
namespace:

1. Starts when System Monitor starts.

2. Lets you register the provided system monitor classes (they are registered in %SYS by default).

3. Lets you activate the system and user-defined classes you w ant to monitor. You can activate any registered system

class; you can activate any user-defined class that is present in the local namespace. F or example, if you have created
a user-defined class only in the USER namespace, you can acti vate that class only in the USER namespace.

4. Monitors each active class by sampling the metrics specified by the class. These metrics represent the properties

returned by the sample class called by the GetSample() method of the monitor class. For example, the %Monitor.System.LockTable class calls %Monitor.System.Sample.LockTable which returns (among others) the properties TotalSpace, containing the total size of the lock table, and UsedSpace, containing the size of the lock table space in use. The sampled data, along with monitor and class metadata, is stored in the local namespace and can be accessed by all object and SQL methods.

5.

If an alert is configured for a class and the class returns a property v alue satisfying the evaluation expression configured in it, generates an email message or calls a class method, if one of these actions is configured in the alert. F or example, you can first configure email notifications to a list of recipients, then configure an alert for the
%Monitor.System.LockTable
class, specifying that an email be sent when the ratio of the UsedSpace property of %Monitor.System.Sample.LockTable to the TotalSpace property is greater than .9 (90% full).

Note:

The %Monitor.System.HistorySys and %Monitor.System.HistoryPerf classes provided with Application Monitor, when activated, create and maintain a historical database of system usage and performance metrics to help you analyze system usage and performance issues over time. These classes and %Monitor.System.HistoryUser run only in %SYS and cannot be registered in other namespaces. See History Monitor for more information about these classes and the historical database.

### 7.2 Using ^%SYSMONMGR to Manage Application Monitor

As described in Using the ^%SYSMONMGR Utility, the ^%SYSMONMGR utility lets you manage and configure System Monitor, including Application Monitor. The utility can be executed in any namespace, and changes made with it affect only the namespace in which it is started. You must maintain a separate Application Monitor configuration for each startup namespace you configure by starting ^%SYSMONMGR in that namespace.

Note:

Following any change you make to the Application Monitor configuration, such as acti vating a class, you must restart System Monitor in the namespace in which you made the change for the change to take effect.

To manage Application Monitor, enter the following command in the Terminal:

%SYS>do ^%SYSMONMGR

then enter 5 for Manage Application Monitor. The following menu displays:

2) Manage Monitor Classes 3) Change Default Notification Method 4) Manage Email Options 6) Debug Monitor Classes 7) Exit

Option?

Enter the number of your choice or press Enter to exit the Application Monitor utility.

#### 7.2.1 Manage Application Monitor

The options in the main menu let you manage Application Monitor as described in the following table:

Option

Description

1) Set Sample
Interval

Sets the interval at which metrics are sampled; the default is 30 seconds. This
setting can be overridden for an individual class by setting a class-specific interval (using the Set Class Sample Interval option on the Manage Monitor Classes submenu).

Note: if the System Monitor sampling interval (see Set Sample Interval in the Set System Monitor Options submenu) is longer than the sampling interval for an Application Monitoring class, the longer of the two intervals is used. For example, if the System Monitor interval is 30 and the Application Monitor interval is 120, all
active Application Monitor classes are sampled every 120 seconds; if the System
Monitor interval is 60 and the %Monitor.System.LockTable class interval is 20, the class is sampled every 60 seconds.

2) Manage Monitor
Classes

Displays the Manage Monitor Classes submenu which lets you manage systemand user-defined monitor classes in the namespace in which you are running the Application Monitor Manager.

3) Change Default
Notification
Method

Lets you specify the default action for alerts when triggered. Any alerts you create use this action unless you specify otherwise.

4) Manage Email

following table:

Option

Description

1) Activate /
Deactivate Monitor
Class

Application Monitor samples active classes only. This option lets you activate an inactive class, or deactivate an active one. You can display a numbered list of the system and user-defined classes registered in the local namespace, including the activation state of each, by entering ? at the Class? prompt, then enter either the number or class name.

2) List Monitor
Classes

Displays a list of the system- and user-defined classes registered in the local namespace, including the activation state of each.

Option

Description

3) Register
Monitor System
Classes

4) Remove/Purge
Class

Registers all system monitor classes (except the %Monitor.System.HistorySys, %Monitor.System.HistoryPerf, and %Monitor.System.HistoryUser classes) and stores them in the local namespace. System classes must still be activated using option 1) Activate/Deactivate Monitor Class on this menu for sampling to begin.

Removes a monitor class from the list of classes in the local namespace. You can display a numbered list of the system and user-defined classes registered in the local namespace, including the activation state of each, by entering ? at the Class? prompt, then enter either the number or class name.

Note:

This option does not remove the class, but simply removes the name of the class from the list of registered classes that can be activated. To reset the list, choose option 3) Register Monitor System Classes on this menu.

5) Set Class
Sample Interval

Lets you override the default Application Monitor sampling interval, specified by the 1) Set Sample Interval option of the Manage Application Monitor menu, for a single class. The default is 0, which means the class does not have a class-specific sample interval.

See the description of the Set Sample Interval option for an explanation of precedence between this setting, the Set Sample Interval setting, and the System Monitor sample interval discussed in Set System Monitor Options.

6) Debug Monitor
Classes

Displays Debug Monitor Classes menu which lets you enable and disable debugging as well as lists errors.

##### 7.2.2.1 Debug Monitor Classes

This submenu lets you manage system debugging.

Debugging monitor classes adds the capability to capture any errors generated during the collection of sample values by user-defined Application Monitor classes.

Enter the number of your choice or press Enter to return to the main menu:

Option? 6

1) Enable Debug 2) Disable Debug 3) List Errors 4) Exit

Option?

The options in this submenu let you manage debugging for Application Monitor as described in the following table:

Description

1) Enable

2) Disable
Debug

Lets you disable debugging.

Description

3) List Errors

Displays the definitions of all errors in the local namespace; for example:

%Save(), %New(), Initialize() and GetSample().

Enable debugging for the class using ^%SYSMONMGR, and the System Monitor will save the last error caught for specific methods within the class.

#### 7.2.3 Change Default Notification Method

When you create an alert, you specify an action to be taken when it is triggered; the default choice for this action is the
default notification method, set using this option. Enter the number of your choice or press Enter to return to the main menu:

Option? 3

Notify Action (0=none,1=email,2=method)? 0 =>

The choice you make with this option is used when you configure an alert to use the def ault notification method, as described
in the following table:

Description

Do not take action when an alert is triggered.

Send an email message to the configured recipients when an alert is triggered. For information about configuring email, see Manage Email Options.

Call a notification method when an alert is triggered. If you select this action, the method is called with two arguments – the application name specified in the alert and a %List object containing the properties returned to the monitor class by the sample class (as described in Application Monitor Overview). When prompted, enter the full class name and method, that is packagename.classname.method. This method must exist in the local namespace.

#### 7.2.4 Manage Email Options

The options in this submenu let you configure and enable email. When email is enabled, Application Monitor sends email notifications when an alert configured for them is triggered. Enter the number of your choice or press Enter to return to the
main menu:

Option? 4

1) Enable/Disable Email 4) Manage Recipients 5) Set Authorization 7) Exit

Option?

The options in this submenu let you manage the email notifications for the Application Monitor as described in the following
table:

Option

Description

1) Enable /
Disable Email

Enabling email makes it possible for Application Monitor to send email notifications when alerts are triggered, if configured. Disabling email prevents Application Monitor from sending email notifications when an alert is triggered.

Note:

It is not necessary to reconfigure email options when you disable and then reenable email.

This option is required. Enter text identifying the sender of the email. Depending on the specified outgoing mail server, this may or may not have to be a valid email account.

This option is required. Enter the name of the server that handles outgoing email for your site. If you are not sure, your IT staff should be able to provide this information.

4) Manage
Recipients

This option displays a submenu that lets you list, add, or remove valid email
addresses of recipients:

1) List Recipients 2) Add Recipient 3) Remove Recipient 4) Exit

When adding or removing recipients, email addresses must be entered individually, one per line. Addresses of invalid format are rejected.

5) Set
Authorization

Lets you specify the authorization username and password if required by your email server. Consult your IT staff to obtain this information. If you do not provide entries, the authorization username and password are set to NULL.

Sends a test message to the specified recipients using the specified email server. If the attempt fails, the resulting error message may help you fix the problem.

#### 7.2.5 Manage Alerts

An alert specifies:

- a condition within the namespace that is of concern to you, defined by the v alues of properties sampled by a monitor class.

- an action to be taken to notify you when that condition occurs.

To return to the previous example, you might create an alert specifying:

- Condition: The lock table is over 90% full, defined by the UsedSpace property (returned when the %Monitor.System.LockTable class calls %Monitor.System.Sample.LockTable) being more than 90% of the TotalSpace property.

- Action: Send an email notification.

The definition of a condition based on properties is called an evaluation expression; after specifying the properties of the
sample class you want to use, you specify the evaluation expression. Properties are indicated in the expression by place-
holders corresponding to the order in which you provide them; for example, if when creating the lock table alert you specify

the UsedSpace property first and then the TotalSpace property, you would enter the evaluation expression as %1 / %2 > .9, but if you enter the properties in the reverse order, the expression would be %2 / %1 > .9.

When the alert menu displays, enter the number of your choice or press Enter to return to the main menu:

Option? 2

1) Create Alert 2) Edit Alert 3) List Alerts 4) Delete Alert 5) Enable/Disable Alert 6) Clear NotifyOnce Alert 7) Exit

Option?

The options in this submenu let you manage alerts for the Application Monitor as described in the following table:

Description

1) Create
Alert

Lets you define a new alert. For a description of the prompts and responses, see the Responses to Alert Prompts. The newly created alert is enabled by default.

2) Edit Alert

Lets you modify an existing alert. Enter the name of the alert to edit, or enter ? for a list of existing alerts and then enter a number or name.

Note: You must respond to all prompts including those that you do not want to modify;
that is, you must re-enter information for fields that you do not want to modify as well as the revised information for the fields you are modifying. For a description of the prompts and responses, see Responses to Alert Prompts.

Action: email

Class: %Monitor.System.LockTable

Property: UsedSpace,TotalSpace

Expression: %1/%2>.9

Notify Once: True

Enabled: Yes

4) Delete
Alert

Lets you delete an existing alert. Enter the name of the alert to edit, or enter ? for a list of existing alerts and then enter a number or name.

Note: Each alert must be entered individually; that is, you cannot specify a series or

range of alerts to delete.

5) Enable /
Disable Alert

Enabling an alert activates it. Disabling an alert deactivates it.

Note:

It is not necessary to reconfigure alert options when you disable and then reenable an alert.

Description

### 7.3 Application Monitor Metrics

The system monitor classes included with Application Monitor call various sample classes, as shown in the following table:

Sample Classes

Audit metrics

Client metrics

Web Gateway metrics

Disk space metrics

Free space metrics

Global metrics

History database metrics (see History Monitor)

Journal metrics

License metrics

Lock table metrics

Process metrics

Routine metrics

Server metrics

Application Monitor System Classes

%Monitor.System.Sample.AuditCount and
%Monitor.System.Sample.AuditEvents

%Monitor.System.Sample.Clients

%Monitor.System.Sample.CSPGateway

%Monitor.System.Sample.Diskspace

%Monitor.System.Sample.Freespace

%Monitor.System.Sample.Globals

%Monitor.System.Sample.HistoryPerf,
%Monitor.System.Sample.HistorySys,
%Monitor.System.Sample.HistoryUser

%Monitor.System.Sample.Journals

%Monitor.System.Sample.License

%Monitor.System.Sample.LockTable

%Monitor.System.Sample.Processes

%Monitor.System.Sample.Routines

%Monitor.System.Sample.Servers

System activity metrics

%Monitor.System.Sample.SystemMetrics

For a list of properties corresponding to the sample metrics in each category, see the InterSystems Class Reference.

Similar functions that control the MONITOR facility are available through the classes in the %Monitor.System package, which also allows you to save the data as a named collection in a persistent object format. See the %Monitor.System.Sample package classes and the %Monitor.System.SystemMetrics class documentation in the InterSystems Class Reference for more details.

#### 7.3.1 Generating Metrics

The %Monitor.SampleAgent class does the actual sampling, invoking the Initialize() and GetSample() methods of the metrics classes.

The %Monitor.SampleAgent.%New() constructor takes one argument: the name of the metrics class to run. It creates an instance of that class, and invokes the Startup() method on that class. Then, each time the %Monitor.SampleAgent.Collect() method is invoked, the Sample Agent invokes the Initialize() method for the class, then repeatedly invokes the GetSample() method for the class. On each call to GetSample(), %Monitor.SampleAgent creates a sample class for the metrics class. The
pseudocode for these operations is:

set sampler = ##class(%Monitor.SampleAgent).%New("MyMetrics.Freespace")
/* at this point, the sampler has created an instance of MyMetrics.Freespace,
and invoked its Startup method */
for I=1:1:10 { do sampler.Collect() hang 10 }
/* at each iteration, sampler calls MyMetrics.Freespace.Initialize(), then loops
on GetSample(). Whenever GetSample() returns $$$OK, sampler creates a new
MyMetrics.Sample.Freespace instance, with the sample data. When GetSample() returns an error value, no sample is created, and sampler.Collect() returns. */

#### 7.3.2 Viewing Metrics Data

All metrics classes are CSP-enabled; the CSP code is generated automatically when the sample class is generated. Therefore,
the simplest way to view metrics is using a web browser. Based on the example in Generating Metrics, the CSP URL has
the following form, which uses the <baseURL> for your instance:
http://<baseURL>/csp/user/MyMetrics.Sample.Freespace.cls. The output displayed is similar to:

Monitor - Freespace c:\InterSystems\IRIS51\ Name of dataset: c:\InterSystems\IRIS51\ Current amount of Freespace: 8.2MB

Monitor - Freespace c:\InterSystems\IRIS51\mgr\ Name of dataset: c:\InterSystems\IRIS51\mgr\ Current amount of Freespace: 6.4MB

Alternatively, you can use the Display(metric_class) method of the %Monitor.View class; for example:

%SYS>set mclass="Monitor.Test.Freespace"

%SYS>set col=##class(%Monitor.SampleAgent).%New(mclass)

%SYS>write col.Collect() 1
%SYS>write ##class(%Monitor.View).Display(mclass)

Monitor - Freespace c:\InterSystems\IRIS51\ Name of dataset: c:\InterSystems\IRIS51\ Current amount of Freespace: 8.2MB

Monitor - Freespace c:\InterSystems\IRIS51\mgr\ Name of dataset: c:\InterSystems\IRIS51\mgr\ Current amount of Freespace: 6.4MB

Note:

The URL for a class with % (percent sign) in the name must use %25 in its place. For example, the URL for the
%Monitor.System.Freespace class has the following form, which uses the <baseURL> for your instance:

http://<baseURL>/csp/sys/%25Monitor.System.Freespace.cls

### 7.4 Writing User-Defined Application Monitor Classes

In addition to the provided system classes, you can write your monitor and sample classes to monitor user application data and counters.

A monitor class is any class that inherits from the abstract Monitor class, %Monitor.Adaptor; the %Monitor.System classes
are examples of such classes. To create your own user-defined monitor classes:

1. Run ^%MONAPPMGR in the namespace where you want to monitor data. Use option 2 to list monitor classes, and

within that menu, use option 3 to register monitor system classes.

SAMPLES>d ^%MONAPPMGR

2) Manage Monitor Classes 3) Change Default Notification Method 4) Manage Email Options 6) Exit

Option? 2

6) Exit

Option? 3 Exporting to XML started on 06/21/2022 12:52:36 Exporting class: Monitor.Sample Export finished successfully.

6) Exit

Option?

2. Write a class that inherits from %Monitor.Adaptor. The inheritance provides persistence, parameters, properties, code
generation, and a projection that generates the monitor metadata from your class definition. See the %Monitor.Adaptor class documentation for full details on this class, as well as the code you must write.

3. Compile your class. Compiling classes that inherit from %Monitor.Adaptor generates new sample classes in a subpackage

of the users class called Sample. For example, if you compile A.B.MyMetric, a new class is generated in A.B.Sample.MyMetric. You do not need to do anything with the generated class.

Important: When deleting application monitor classes, only the monitor class should be deleted; that is, do not

delete generated sample classes. Use the Management Portal to delete only the monitor class (for
example, A.B.MyMetric) from which the sample class (for example, A.B.Sample.MyMetric) is generated;
this automatically deletes both the monitor class and generated sample class.

All sample classes are automatically CSP-enabled, so that sample data for the user's metrics may be viewed by pointing to A.B.Sample.MyMetric.cls. Application Monitor automatically invokes this class and generates data and alerts, if the class
has been activated; for information about activating monitor classes, see Manage Monitor Classes.

Important:

The SECURITYRESOURCE parameter is empty in %Monitor.Adaptor, and therefore in user classes inheriting from %Monitor.Adaptor unless explicitly modified. Code generation copies the SECURITYRESOURCE value from the user-defined class to the generated sample class.

The following simple example retrieves the free space for each dataset in an InterSystems IRIS instance.

Each sampling requests n instances of sample data objects, each instance corresponding to a dataset. In this example, each instance has only a single property, the free space available in that dataset when the sample was collected.

1. Create a class that inherits from %Monitor.Adaptor:

Class Definition

Class MyMetric.Freespace Extends %Monitor.Adaptor [ ProcedureBlock ]
{
}

2. Add properties that you want to be part of the sample data. Their types must be classes within the %Monitor package:

- Gauge

- Integer

- Numeric

- String

For example:

Class Definition

Class MyMetric.Freespace Extends %Monitor.Adaptor [ ProcedureBlock ]
{
/// Name of dataset
Property DBName As %Monitor.String(CAPTION = "Database Name");

/// Current amount of Freespace
Property FreeSpace As %Monitor.String;
}

3. Add an INDEX parameter that tells which fields form a unique k ey among the instances of the samples:

Class Member

Parameter INDEX = "DBName";

4. Add control properties as needed, marking them [Internal] so they do not become part of the storage definition in

the generated class.

Class Member

/// Result Set for use by the class
Property Rspec As %SQL.StatementResult [Internal];

5. Override the Initialize() method. Initialize() is called at the start of each metrics gathering run.

Class Member

/// Initialize the list of datasets and freespace.
Method Initialize() As %Status
{
set stmt=##class(%SQL.Statement).%New()
set status= stmt.%PrepareClassQuery("SYS.Database","FreeSpace") set ..Rspec = stmt.%Execute()
return $$$OK
}

6. Override the GetSample() method. GetSample() is called repeatedly until a status of 0 is returned. You write code to

populate the metrics data for each sample instance.

Class Member

/// Get dataset metric sample.
/// A return code of $$$OK indicates there is a new sample instance.
/// A return code of 0 indicates there is no sample instance.
Method GetSample() As %Status
{
// Get freespace data
set stat = ..Rspec.%Next(.sc)

// Quit if we have done all the datasets
if 'stat {
Quit 0
}

// populate this instance
set ..DBName = ..Rspec.%Get("Directory") set ..FreeSpace = ..Rspec.%Get("Available")

// quit with return value indicating the sample data is ready
return $$$OK
}

7. Compile the class. The class is shown below:

Class Definition

Class MyMetric.Freespace Extends %Monitor.Adaptor
{
Parameter INDEX = "DBName";

/// Name of dataset
Property DBName As %Monitor.String;

/// Current amount of Freespace
Property FreeSpace As %Monitor.String;

/// Result Set
Property Rspec As %SQL.StatementResult [Internal];

/// Initialize the list of datasets and freespace.
Method Initialize() As %Status
{
set stmt=##class(%SQL.Statement).%New()
set status= stmt.%PrepareClassQuery("SYS.Database","FreeSpace") set ..Rspec = stmt.%Execute()
return $$$OK
}

/// Get routine metric sample.
/// A return code of $$$OK indicates there is a new sample instance.
/// Any other return code indicates there is no sample instance.
Method GetSample() As %Status
{
// Get freespace data
set stat = ..Rspec.%Next(.sc)

// Quit if we have done all the datasets
if 'stat {
Quit 0
}

// populate this instance
set ..DBName = ..Rspec.%Get("Directory") set ..FreeSpace = ..Rspec.%Get("Available")

// quit with return value indicating the sample data is ready
return $$$OK
}

}

8. Additionally, you can override the Startup() and Shutdown() methods. These methods are called once when sampling

begins, so you can open channels or perform other one-time-only initialization:

/// Open a tcp/ip device to send warnings
Property io As %Status;

Method Startup() As %Status
{
set ..io="|TCP|2" set host="127.0.0.1" open ..io:(host:^serverport:"M"):200
}

Method Shutdown() As %Status
{
close ..io
}

9. Compiling the class creates a new class, MyMetric.Sample.Freespace in the MyMetric.Sample package :

Class Definition

/// Persistent sample class for MyMetric.Freespace
Class MyMetric.Sample.Freespace Extends Monitor.Sample
{
Parameter INDEX = "DBName";

Property Application As %String [ InitialExpression = "MyMetric" ];

/// Name of dataset
Property DBName As %Monitor.String(CAPTION = "");

/// Current amount of Freespace
Property FreeSpace As %Monitor.String(CAPTION = "");

Property GroupName As %String [ InitialExpression = "Freespace" ];

Property MetricsClass As %String [ InitialExpression = "MyMetric.Freespace" ];

}

Note:

You should not modify this class. You may, however, inherit from it to write custom queries against your sample data.

Important:

If you do modify and recompile an active user-defined Application monitor class, the class is deactivated
and the class-specific sample interv al override, if any, is removed; to restore it, you must activate it,
reset the sample interval if desired, and restart of System Monitor.

To run the ^GLOSTAT routine you must be in the %SYS namespace. The name of the routine is case-sensitive. Type the
following command and press Enter:

ObjectScript

do ^GLOSTAT

The ^GLOSTAT routine displays statistics, as seen in Example A. Each time InterSystems IRIS starts, it initializes the
^GLOSTAT statistical counters; the initial output of ^GLOSTAT reflects operations since InterSystems IRIS has started.

The following prompt appears beneath the report:

Continue (c), Timed Stats (# sec > 0), Quit (q)?

You may enter one of the following:

Response

Action

q

# (a positive integer
indicating number of seconds)

Displays the report again with updated cumulative statistics since the last initialization.

Quits the ^GLOSTAT routine.

Initializes statistics, counts statistics for the indicated number of seconds, and reports statistics as an average per second (Example B).

Gathering Global Activity Statistics Using ^GLOSTAT

### 8.2 Overview of ^GLOSTAT Statistics

Each ^GLOSTAT statistic represents the number of times a type of event has occurred since InterSystems IRIS has started, or per second during a defined interv al. You may run ^GLOSTAT at any time from the system manager’s namespace. In most cases, you should run the utility on an active system, not an idle one.

If the InterSystems IRIS instance is a stand-alone configuration or an ECP data serv er, then the report displays only the
“Total” column. If it is an ECP application server (that is, it connects to a remote database) then three columns are shown:
“Local,” “Remote,” and “Total” (Example C).

The following table defines the ^GLOSTAT statistics.

Table 8–1: Statistics Produced by ^GLOSTAT

Statistic

Definition

Global references (all)

Logical count of accesses to globals, including Sets, Kills, $Data, $Order,
$Increment, $Query, and global references in expressions.

Global update references

Private global references

Private update references

Logical count of global references that are Sets, Kills, or $Increments.

The count of all process private global accesses.

The count of process private global references that are SETs or KILLs, etc.

Routine calls

Number of calls to a routine.

Routine buffer loads and saves

Total number of routine loads and saves as a result of ZLoad, ZSave, and running routines. (In a well-tuned environment, this number increases slowly, since most routine loads are satisfied by the routine cache memory without accessing the disk. Each routine load or save transfers up to 32 KB of data (64 KB for Unicode).)

Routine commands

Number of routine commands executed since system startup.

Routine not cached

Number of routines not cached in memory. This information help you determine whether or not the routine buffer cache is adequately sized.

Logical block requests

Number of database blocks read by the globals database code. (In a well-tuned environment, many of these reads are satisfied without disk access.)

Block reads

Block writes

Number of physical database blocks read from disk for both global and routine references.

Number of physical database blocks written to disk for both global and routine references.

WIJ writes

Number of writes to the write image journal file.

Cache Efficiency

Number of all global references divided by the number of physical block reads and writes. Not a percentage.

Journal Entries

Number of journal records created—one for each database modification (Set , Kill, etc.) or transaction event (TStart, TCommit) or other event that is saved to the journal.

Journal Block Writes

Number of 64-KB journal blocks written to the journal file.

Monitoring System Performance Using
^PERFMON

This page describes how to monitor system performance using the ^PERFMON utility.

### 9.1 Introduction

^PERFMON is an ObjectScript utility that controls the MONITOR facility.

The MONITOR facility provides performance data for the InterSystems IRIS® data platform system by collecting counts of events at the system level and sorting the metrics by process, routine, global, and network nodes. Since there is some overhead involved in collecting this data, you must specifically enable the collection of counters and collect data for a specific number of processes, globals, routines, and netw ork nodes. InterSystems IRIS allocates memory at MONITOR startup to create slots for the number of processes, routines, globals, and nodes specified. The first process to trigger an event counter allocates the first slot and continues to add to that set of counters. Once the f acility allocates all the available slots to processes, it includes any subsequent process counts in the Other slot. It follows the same procedure for globals, routines, and nodes.

You can review reports of the data while collection is in progress. When you stop collection, memory is de-allocated and the counter slots are gone. So, any retention of the numbers needs to be handled by writing the reports to a file (or a global). Data is given as rates per second by default, although there is also an option for gathering the raw totals. There are also functions which allow you to pause/resume the collection, and zero the counters.

The menu items available by running ^PERFMON correspond directly to functions available in the ^PERFMON routine, and the input collected is used to directly supply the parameters of these functions.

Similar functions that control the same MONITOR facility are available through the classes in the %Monitor.System package. For more information see Application Monitor and Examining Routine Performance Using ^%SYS.MONLBL.

### 9.2 Using ^PERFMON

You can run the ^PERFMON routine in two ways: interactively in the InterSystems Terminal, or by individual calls to its functions. All the options of ^PERFMON are available using either method.

^PERFMON contains the following functions:

- Stop

- Pause

- Resume

- Sample Counters

- Report

- Collect

- Each function returns a status of success (1) or failure (a negative number, followed by a comma and a brief message).

- Because ^PERFMON and the line-by-line monitor routine ^%SYS.MONLBL share the same memory allocation, you can only run one of them at a time on an InterSystems IRIS instance. You see the following message if you try to run
^PERFMON and ^%SYS.MONLBL has started monitoring:

The Line-by-line Monitor is already enabled. This must be stopped before ^PERFMON can be used.

#### 9.2.1 Running ^PERFMON Interactively

The following is an example of running the ^PERFMON routine interactively from the Terminal:

1. Enter the following command from the %SYS namespace:

do ^PERFMON

2. The following menu appears. Enter the number of your choice, or press Enter to exit the routine.

1. Start Monitor
2. Stop Monitor
3. Pause Monitor
4. Resume Monitor
5. Sample Counters
6. Clear Counters
7. Report Statistics
8. Timed Collect and Report

Monitor is Stopped

Enter the number of your choice:

3. Each option corresponds directly to a ^PERFMON function, and will prompt you for the necessary parameters. For

example, entering 1 corresponds to Start function:

1. Start Monitor
2. Stop Monitor
3. Pause Monitor
4. Resume Monitor
5. Sample Counters
6. Clear Counters
7. Report Statistics
8. Timed Collect & Report

Monitor is Stopped

Enter the number of your choice: 1

- Monitoring Routine Performance Using
^PROFILE

- The ^PROFILE utility helps programmers analyze the performance of their application routines and classes. It accomplishes
this task in two phases:

1.

2.

It gathers data, sorted at the routine level, to help you identify which routines do the most “work.”

It lets you select routines for which you want to gather and display data (subroutines, procedures, and individual lines) at line-level detail so that you can “drill down” into the individual routines that may be causing performance issues.

By default, ^PROFILE captures metrics for up to 5000 routines; if there is not enough shared memory available for the
maximum number of routines, the utility displays a message about the number of pages of memory required to monitor this collection and the number of pages available. Then, the utility captures metrics for as many routines as possible.

### 10.1 Using ^PROFILE

Invoke the (^PROFILE) utility from the %SYS namespace:

%SYS>do ^PROFILE

When you are prompted to start the collection of data, press Enter.

Note: When you are prompted for a response (other than Yes or No) you can enter ? to display online help.

By default, the profile displays a numbered list of routines with the follo wing metrics; initially, the list is sorted by the
RtnLine metrics:

Column Title (Metric)

Description

RtnLine

Time

CPU

Number of routine lines of code executed. By default, it lists the value as a percentage of all lines of code executed.

Elapsed time used to execute the routine. By default, the time is listed as a percentage of the total time used by all routines.

CPU time used to execute the routine. By default, the entry is listed as a percentage of the total CPU time used by all routines.

Examining Routine Performance Using
^%SYS.MONLBL

The routine ^%SYS.MONLBL provides a user interface to the InterSystems IRIS® data platform MONITOR facility. This utility provides a way to diagnose where time is spent executing selected code in routines, helping to identify lines of code that are particularly resource intensive. It is an extension of the existing MONITOR utility accessed through ^PERFMON and the %Monitor.System package classes. Because these utilities share the same memory allocation, you can only run one of them at a time on an InterSystems IRIS instance.

### 11.1 Invoking the Line-by-line Monitoring Routine

If the monitor is not running when you invoke ^%SYS.MONLBL, the routine displays a warning message and gives you
the option to start the monitor or to check memory requirements. For example:

%SYS>Do ^%SYS.MONLBL

WARNING ! Starting the line-by-line monitor will enable the collection of statistics for *every* line of code executed by the selected routines and processes. This can have a significant impact on the performance of a system, and it is recommended that you do this on a 'test' system.

The line-by-line monitor also allocates shared memory to track these statistics for each line of each routine selected. This is taken from the general shared memory already allocated and should be considered if you are using '*' wildcards and trying to analyze a large number of routines. If the monitor fails to start due to a problem with memory allocation, you may need to increase the Generic Memory Heap (gmheap) parameter in the system configuration. You may use the 'Memory Requirements' option to see how much memory a collection would need (without starting the collection).

1.) Start Monitor 2.) Memory Requirements

Enter the number of your choice:

- Enter 1 to begin the dialog to provide the appropriate information to start monitoring.

- Enter 2 to calculate an estimate of how much memory a collection needs before actually starting the monitor. See Estimate Memory Requirements for details.

- Press the Enter key to exit the routine.

#### 11.1.1 Start Monitoring

You can select which routines and processes to monitor and which metrics to collect. These characteristics of the collection
remain until you stop the monitor. You provide monitoring collection information to the routine in the following order:

1. Routine Names – Enter a list of routine names to monitor. You can only select routines accessible from your current
namespace. Do not use the leading ^ when entering the routine name; the names are case-sensitive. You may use
asterisk (*) wild cards to select multiple routines. Press Enter twice after entering the last routine name to end the list.

2. Select Metrics to monitor – Enter the number of your choice of what type of metrics. The default is 1 for

minimal metrics.

Select Metrics to monitor 1) Monitor Minimal Metrics 2) Monitor Lines (Coverage) 3) Monitor Global Metrics 4) Monitor All Metrics 5) Customize Monitor Metrics

Enter the number of your choice: <1>

A description of what metrics are included for each option follows:

- Minimal metrics — Monitors the metrics described in the following table.

Metric

Description

Metric#: 34 - RtnLine

Number of times a routine line is executed

Metric#: 51 - Time

Clock time spent in executing that line

Metric#: 52 - TotalTime

Total clock time for that line including time spent in subroutines called by that line

The time metrics are clock time and are measured in seconds.

Note:

Total Time for Recursive Code When a routine contains recursive code, the TotalTime counter for the line which calls back into the same subroutine only records the time of the outermost call, which should be, in most cases, the actual time to run the recursive loop. Prior InterSystems IRIS releases accumulated the time for multiple iterations of the same code reporting times that may have seemed too large.

- Lines — Monitors the number of times a routine line is executed (Metric#: 34 - RtnLine).

- Global metrics — Monitors several global metrics (Metric# 1-26,34-36,51,52).

- All metrics — Monitors all available metrics.

- Customize metrics — Allows you to create a customized list of metrics to monitor. You can select any of the standard performance metrics supported by the %Monitor.System package classes. Enter a question mark (?) when
prompted for the metric item number to see a list of available metrics. For example:

Enter the number of your choice: <1> 5

Enter metrics item number (press 'Enter' to terminate, ? for list)

Metric#: ?
1.) GloRef: global refs 2.) GloSet: global sets . . . 34.) RtnLine: lines of ObjectScript . . . 51.) Time: elapsed time on wall clock 52.) TotalTime: total time used (including sub-routines)
Metric#:

This example does not show the full list; it is best for you to retrieve the current list when you run the routine. See
Line-by-line Monitor Programming Interface for a method of retrieving the list.

Note:

For all collections, the number of routine lines and time (minimal metrics) are always collected.

3. Select Processes to monitor – Enter the number of your choice as it appears in the menu. The default is 1

for all processes.

Select Processes to monitor 1.) Monitor All Processes 2.) Monitor Current Process Only 3.) Enter list of PIDs

Enter the number of your choice: <1>

^%SYS.MONLBL does not currently provide a list or a way to select PIDs; however, you can use the ^%SS utility
or the Processes page of the Management Portal (System Operation > Processes) to find specific process ID numbers.

Enter the number of your choice: <1> 3

Enter PID (press 'Enter' to terminate)

PID: 1640 PID: 2452
PID:

Press Enter twice after entering the last process ID to end the list.

Once you provide the necessary information, ^%SYS.MONLBL allocates a special section of shared memory for counters for each line per routine, and notifies the selected processes that monitoring is acti vated.

Note:

Since shared counters may be updated simultaneously by multiple processes and/or running processes may not start counting at exactly the same moment, there may be a slight loss of precision in the counters, resulting in counts being lower than expected.

Monitor started.

Press RETURN to continue ...

After starting the line-by-line monitor, the routine displays a more extensive menu. Line-by-line Monitoring Options describes each option on this extended menu.

#### 11.1.2 Estimate Memory Requirements

Before starting the monitoring process you can use this utility to estimate how much memory a collection requires. Typically, there is sufficient shared memory a vailable for monitoring a few routines. However, if you want to monitor hundreds or more routines, use this option to help determine memory needs.

The routine and metrics prompts are identical to those for the Start Monitor choice. After you select the routines to monitor and the metrics to gather, the utility displays the number of pages of memory required to monitor this collection and the number of pages available. It also tells you to increase the size of the generic memory heap parameter if necessary.

You can maintain the gmheap (generic memory heap) setting from the Advanced Memory Settings page of the Management Portal (System Administration > Configuration > Additional Settings > Advanced Memory).

The following is an example that estimates the memory requirements for monitoring eight selected metrics for all routines
that begin with JRN:

Enter the number of your choice: 2

Enter routine names to be monitored on a line by line basis. Patterns using '*' are allowed. Enter '?L' to see a list of routines already selected. Press 'Enter' to terminate input.

Routine Name: JRN* (22 routines added to selection.)
Routine Name:

Select Metrics to monitor 1) Monitor Minimal Metrics 2) Monitor Lines (Coverage) 3) Monitor Global Metrics 4) Monitor All Metrics 5) Customize Monitor Metrics

Enter the number of your choice: <1> 5

Enter metrics item number (press 'Enter' to terminate, ? for list)

Metric#: 1 - GloRef Metric#: 2 - GloSet Metric#: 3 - GloKill Metric#: 25 - JrnEntry Metric#: 34 - RtnLine Metric#: 35 - RtnLoad Metric#: 51 - Time Metric#: 52 - TotalTime
Metric#:

## 9 page(s) of memory required. 82 page(s) of memory available.

The GenericHeapSize parameter can be increased if more memory is needed. Pages are each 64kb of memory.

Press RETURN to continue ...

You may adjust your memory if that is required for your selected collection and then choose to start monitoring from the original menu.

### 11.2 Line-by-line Monitoring Options

If you invoke ^%SYS.MONLBL while the monitor is running you have the following menu options:

Line-by-line Monitoring Options

2.) Pause Monitor / Resume Monitor

Enter the number of your choice:

The first three options are f airly self-explanatory:

- Stop Monitor — Stops all ^%SYS.MONLBL monitoring; deallocates the counter memory and deletes collected
data.

- Pause Monitor — Pauses the collection and maintains any collected data. This may be useful when viewing collected data to ensure that counts are not changing as the report is displayed. This option only appears if the monitor is running.

- Resume Monitor — Resumes collection after a pause. This option only appears if you paused the monitor.

Clear Counters — Clears any collected data, but continues monitoring and collecting new data.

The following subsections explain the four report options.

#### 11.2.1 Report Line-by-line Statistics

When you choose to report the statistics of the metrics that have been collecting (options 4–7), you then provide information about how you want the routine to report the statistics.

You have four types of reports to choose from:

- Detail — Generates a report of the selected metrics for each line in the selected routines. The report accumulates and displays totals for each of the performance columns.

- Summary — Generates a report of summary information for each selected routine including coverage and time. The report orders the routines by coverage percentage.

- Delimited (CSV) Output — Generates the same report information as the detail report, but presents it as commadelimited output facilitating its import into a spreadsheet.

- Procedure Level — Generates a report of selected metrics at a subroutine level within the selected routines. InterSystems IRIS allows you to profile usage at the le vel of individual subroutines, procedures, and functions. You can quickly see which subroutines are taking up the most time to run to analyze and improve performance.

Depending on which type of report you choose, you select how you want to display the information:

1.

If you choose the detail or summary report, you can also choose if you want to include a coverage analysis for the lines
executed in each routine you select. For example:

Enter the number of your choice: 4 Include Coverage Analysis summary (Y/N)? y

2. Next, for all but the summary report, select one or more routines from the list of monitored routines that have statistics

available; enter an asterisk (*) for all available routines. For example:

The following routines have been executed during the run, and have detail statistics available for them. 1) JRNDUMP 2) JRNOPTS 3) JRNSTART 4) JRNSWTCH 5) JRNUTIL 6) JRNUTIL2

Enter list of routines, or * for all

3.

If you are entering routine names, after entering the last routine, press Enter again to end the list. For example:

Enter list of routines, or * for all Routine number (*=All)? 1 - JRNDUMP Routine number (*=All)? 2 - JRNOPTS Routine number (*=All)? 5 - JRNUTIL Routine number (*=All)?
FileName:

4. You can enter a file name or a full directory path for the output. You can instead enter nothing and press Enter to display

the report on your terminal.

If you enter a file name b ut not a path, %SYS.MONLBL creates the file in the directory of the current namespace’ s
default database for globals. For example, if running %SYS.MONLBL in the USER namespace:

FileName: monlbl_JRN_dtl.txt

Creates a file for the report in

install-dir\mgr\user named monlbl_JRN_dtl.txt.

5. Press Enter to initiate the reporting of the metrics you are collecting in the format you have chosen.

### 11.3 Sample Line-by-line Detail Report

The following is an example of reporting the detail of the minimal metrics of selected journal utilities including the coverage analysis. The report is sent to the monlbl_JRN_dtl.txt file, a portion of which is displayed.

The following routines have been executed during the run, and have detail statistics available for them. 1) JRNDUMP 2) JRNOPTS 3) JRNSTART 4) JRNSWTCH 5) JRNUTIL 6) JRNUTIL2

Enter list of routines, or * for all Routine number (*=All)? 1 - JRNDUMP Routine number (*=All)? 2 - JRNOPTS Routine number (*=All)? 5 - JRNUTIL Routine number (*=All)? FileName: monlbl_JRN_dtl.txt

Sample Line-by-line Summary Report

Press RETURN to continue ...

For each line of the selected routine(s), the report displays a line number, the counts for each metric, and the text of that line of code (if source code is available). If you requested coverage analysis, it displays after each selected routine.

### 11.8 Line-by-line Monitor Programming Interface

Programmers can also interface with the InterSystems IRIS MONITOR facility through the %Monitor.System.LineByLine
class. Methods are provided for each menu option in ^%SYS.MONLBL. For example, start monitoring by calling:

Set status=##class(%Monitor.System.LineByLine).Start(Routine,Metric,Process)

You can select which routines and processes to monitor. You may also select any of the other standard performance metrics supported by the %Monitor.System classes. Use the Monitor.System.LineByLine.GetMetrics() method to retrieve a list
of metric names:

Set metrics=##class(%Monitor.System.LineByLine).GetMetrics(3)

Selecting 3 as the parameter prints a list of all available metrics with a short description for each to the current device.

Stop monitoring by calling:

Do ##class(%Monitor.System.LineByLine).Stop()

You can retrieve the collected counts using the %Monitor.System.LineByLine:Result query, where the counters for each
line are returned in $LIST format.

See %Monitor.System.LineByLine for more details.

Tracing Process Performance with
^TRACE

The ^TRACE utility offers functionality to trace the execution of InterSystems IRIS processes. Traced processes write events to a trace file with information about the routine line, where it occurred and, if applicable, the global reference.

### 12.1 Using ^TRACE

Note:

The trace files may contain sensiti ve information such as global references or parameters passed to subroutines. They will not contain the values of any globals.

The events available for tracing correspond to the metrics reported in performance monitoring tools (for example ^PERFMON or %SYS.MONLBL). Raw data is written to a trace file,

iristrace_pid.txt, in a specified directory .

Note:

The trace directory must be writable by the processes being traced.

Different sets of trace events can be selected to produce traces for different purposes. Highly detailed application execution
tracing can be achieved; this can include tracing all global references (GloRef), all application subroutine calls (RtnLoad),
or every line of application code executed (RtnLines). Alternatively, tracing can be limited to less common events such as physical block reads (DataBlkRd, UpntBlkRd, etc), network cache misses (NCacheMiss), or block collisions (BlkWait), in order to find all the locations in the application where these occurrences may be af fecting performance.

Note:

The ability to configure the trace, start tracing a process, or use the ^TRACE utility requires
%Admin_Manage:USE.

Monitoring Performance Using
^SystemPerformance

This page describes the ^SystemPerformance utility, (previously named ^pButtons), a tool for collecting detailed performance data about an InterSystems IRIS® data platform instance and the platform on which it is running. You can send the resulting report to the InterSystems Worldwide Response Center (WRC) to help diagnose system problems. ^SystemPerformance is similar to Diagnostic Reports (see Using the Diagnostic Report), but focuses on performance data.

Note:

This utility may be updated between releases. The latest version is available on the WRC distribution site under
Tools.

You can run the profiles in the Terminal or schedule runs in the Management Portal with Task Manager. In addition, you can add, modify, and delete profiles using the API that is included with the utility.

Important:

Before using ^SystemPerformance in any unattended way, generate a test report interactively to ensure that you have the appropriate privileges at the operating-system level. A lack of permissions can result in incomplete or failed reports. Additionally, specific subsections of the report may produce errors or f ail to collect data without the necessary permissions, as seen in environments requiring elevated privileges (e.g.,
UAC).

For example, you might encounter the error:

Error: Access is denied. You're running with a restricted token, try running elevated.

If this occurs, you can open a Windows CMD as administrator, start an ObjectScript shell from there, and then use ^SystemPerformance. Generating and reviewing a test report helps identify and address these issues proactively.

If you share the generated report with InterSystems, note that it includes private application information. InterSystems keeps all data strictly confidential.

### 13.1 Basics

The ^SystemPerformance utility lets you select one or more profiles to run. (The profiles a vailable vary depending on the product version and any customization that has been performed.) Based on the selected profile(s), it generates a set of

log files, which are placed in the output directory . By default, the output directory is the install-dir\mgr directory of the InterSystems IRIS instance, but you can change the output directory.

By default, ^SystemPerformance provides the following profiles:

- 12hours — 12-hour run sampling every 10 seconds

- 24hours — 24-hour run sampling every 10 seconds

- 30mins — 30-minute run sampling every 1 second

- 4hours — 4-hour run sampling every 5 seconds

- 8hours — 8-hour run sampling every 10 seconds

- test — 5-minute TEST run sampling every 30 seconds

To run the ^SystemPerformance utility:

1. Enter the following command, which is case-sensitive and must be run in the %SYS namespace, in the Terminal:

%SYS>do ^SystemPerformance

2. From the main menu that is displayed, enter the number of the profile you w ant to run, or press Enter to exit the utility:

Current log directory: c:\intersystems\iris\mgr\ Windows Perfmon data will be left in raw format.
Available profiles:
## 1 12hours - 12-hour run sampling every 10 seconds
## 2 24hours - 24-hour run sampling every 10 seconds
## 3 30mins - 30-minute run sampling every 1 second
## 4 4hours - 4-hour run sampling every 5 seconds
## 5 8hours - 8-hour run sampling every 10 seconds
## 6 test - 5-minute TEST run sampling every 30 seconds

select profile number to run:

3. After you enter the profile you w ant to run, the utility displays information about the data it is collecting:

select profile number to run: 1 Collection of this sample data will be available in 1920 seconds. The runid for this data is 20111007_1041_30mins.

The generated log files are located in the output directory . The files are identified by the as follows: YYYYMMDD_HHMM_profile_name .log, where YYYYMMDD_HHMM is the year, month, day, hour, and minute
the utility started to collect data; and profile_name is the name of the profile you selected.

runid, which is uniquely named

Note:

To generate complete reports, the user who started the instance must have access to the irisstat executable in the bin directory and write permissions on the mgr or any other specified output directory . Without these permissions, the utility may generate incomplete or failed reports.

On Windows systems, InterSystems recommends that the Windows user account associated with the InterSystems IRIS service belong to the "Performance Monitor Users" group or have administrative privileges. These permissions ensure that ^SystemPerformance can collect necessary metrics for CPU, memory, and disk.

After the utility finishes collecting data (that is, at the end of the period of time specified in the profile), you can generate
a readable performance report; see Generating the ^SystemPerformance Performance Reports.

Stopping ^SystemPerformance

### 13.2 Stopping ^SystemPerformance

You can stop a running profile — stop the collection of data and optionally delete all
$$Stop^SystemPerformance(runid) command. For example, to abort the collection of data for a report identified by the
runid 20111220_1327_12hours and delete all .log files written so f ar, enter the following command in the Terminal in
the %SYS namespace:

.log files for the profile with the

do Stop^SystemPerformance("20111220_1327_12hours")

To stop the job without deleting log files and produce an HTML performance report from those log files, enter:

do Stop^SystemPerformance("20111220_1327_12hours",0)

For more information, see Functions in ^SystemPerformance.

Note:

You must have permission to stop jobs and delete files.

### 13.3 Functions in ^SystemPerformance

The ^SystemPerformance utility provides options for the start, collect, preview, and stop functions as described in the
following list:

Note:

You can run multiple profiles concurrently .

$$run^SystemPerformance("profile")

Starts the specified profile . If successful, returns the runid; if unsuccessful, returns 0.

$$literun^SystemPerformance("profile")

Same as the preceding, except that it does not include operating-system data.

Note:

This option is intended for servers that are running multiple instances of InterSystems IRIS, where the operating-system data would be duplicated.

$$Collect^SystemPerformance("runid")

Produces a readable HTML performance report file for the specified
filename; if unsuccessful, returns 0 follo wed by a carat and the reason for the failure.

runid. If successful, returns 1 and the report

If no runid is supplied, $$Collect generates a report for each completed runid that does not yet have a report.
In this mode, the return value is the number of reports generated followed by a carat and the word ‘collected’. For example 5^collected if 5 reports were generated, or 0^collected if none were. If run at a command prompt,
$$Collect lists which profiles are still running, if an y, and how much time remains for each.

Note:

It is not necessary to call $$Collect as part of standard operations, because ^SystemPerformance
does so automatically. In unusual circumstances such as ^SystemPerformance being interrupted by an
instance restart, if the automatic mechanism does not execute, $$Collect may be needed.

$$Preview^SystemPerformance("runid")

runid. If successful, Produces a readable HTML interim (incomplete) performance report file for the specified returns 1 followed by a carat and the file location. If unsuccessful, returns 0 follo wed by a carat and the reason for the failure.

$$Stop^SystemPerformance("runid",[0])

Stops (aborts) ^SystemPerformance from collecting data for a specified runid and by default deletes the associated .log files produced by the utility . To stop data collection without deleting the .log files and produce an HTML performance report from those log files, include the 0 parameter follo wing the runid.

If unsuccessful, the function returns 0 followed by a carat and the reason for the failure; if successful, it returns:
1:2:3:4_1:2:3:4. The successful status is made up of two parts separated by an underscore: OS-specific and
InterSystems IRIS-specific; within each part, colon-separated v alues specify:

1. Number of jobs successfully stopped

2. Number of jobs that failed to stop

3. Number of files successfully deleted

4. Number of files not deleted

$$waittime^SystemPerformance("runid")

Reports the time until the final HTML file for the specified ready now, otherwise returns a string of the form XX hours YY minutes ZZ seconds.

runid will be complete. If the runid is finished, returns

do EnableEnsqcnt^SystemPerformance()

Enables the collection additional data for interoperability productions.

This optional functionality:

- Collects and displays queue counts for every Interoperability component in each namespace. This is helpful for identifying bottlenecks in productions.

- Provides a map of process IDs and component classes, which can help when tracing system resource usage to specific components, and when estimating pool sizes.

Enabling this feature results in substantially larger ^SystemPerformance output files, which scales based on the number of components.

do DisableEnsqcnt^SystemPerformance()

Disables the collection of additional data for interoperability productions.

In the following example the runid, which is created by ^SystemPerformance, is obtained programmatically, then tested to determine if a full or interim report has been generated. A full report has not been created because the profile has not finished ( "0^not ready" is returned), but an interim report has been created (“1” is returned). Based on this information, you know that an HTML file has been generated.

Generating ^SystemPerformance Performance Reports

The ^SystemPerformance utility automatically generates a full (complete) readable HTML performance report from the log files produced by the ^SystemPerformance utility. You can also use the Preview^SystemPerformance entry point to produces an interim (incomplete) report using the data that is being collected by the profile you selected when you ran the ^SystemPerformance utility.

The generated report files are located in the output directory which is, by def ault, the install-dir\mgr directory of the Inter-
Systems IRIS instance. The files are uniquely identified by names, which are in the follo wing format:
hostname_instance_runid.html, where hostname is the hostname of the system on which the instance of InterSystems IRIS
is running; instance is the name of the instance for which performance data has been collected; and runid is the unique
identifier generated when the ^SystemPerformance utility was run. If the report is an interim report, _Pn is appended to the file name, where P identifies it as a preliminary report and n is the number of the preliminary report.

### 13.5 Scheduling the ^SystemPerformance Utility with Task Manager

This section provides examples using the Task Manager in the Management Portal to schedule ^SystemPerformance to run. For general instructions for how to schedule a task, see Schedule Task Manager.

Note:

The examples describe only the fields that are required. You can edit other fields as desired.

Example 1: Weekly 24-Hour Run

In this example, a task is created to schedule the ^SystemPerformance utility to run a profile named 24hours (which collects
performance data for 24 hours) every Thursday at 09:00:

1. From the Task Manager page of the Management Portal (System Operation > Task Manager), choose the New Task

option to start the Task Scheduler Wizard. Then enter the following information in the specified fields:

- Output file — leave blank; the task has no output (see Changing the Output Directory for information on customizing
the output directory).

2. Click Next. Then enter the following information in the specified fields:

- How often ... — choose Weekly from the drop-down list.

- Select the Thursday check box.

Start Date — enter the start date in the text box.

Click Run once at this time: and enter 09:00:00 in the text box.

3. Click Finish.

Example 2: Daily 30–Minute Run

In this example, a task is created to schedule the ^SystemPerformance utility to run a profile named 30mins (which collects
performance data for 30 minutes) every day at 12:00:

1. From the Task Manager page of the Management Portal (System Operation > Task Manager), choose the New Task

option to start the Task Scheduler Wizard. Then enter the following information in the specified fields:

- Task name — enter 30MinRun.

- Description — enter Start 30-minute ^SystemPerformance Run.

- Namespace to run task in — select %SYS from the drop-down list.

- Task type — select RunLegacyTask from the drop-down list.

- In the ExecuteCode text box, enter the following code:

Output file — leave blank; the task has no output (see Changing the Output Directory for information on customizing
the output directory).

2. Click Next. Then enter the following information in the specified fields:

- How often ... — choose Daily from the drop-down list.

- Start Date — enter the start date in the text box.

Click Run once at this time: and enter 12:00:00 in the text box.

3. Click Finish.

### 13.6 Changing the Output Directory

install-dir\mgr of the InterSystems The default output directory for both the log files and the resulting HTML report file is the IRIS instance for which you are running the ^SystemPerformance utility. You can change the default directory using the commands described in the following list.

Getting Version Information

Note:

These commands do not affect currently running profiles, whether or not the HTML report files ha that is, no files associated with currently running profiles are mo

ved to the new output directory.

ve been produced;

do setlogdir^SystemPerformance("directory")

Sets the pathname of output directory to directory; if the directory does not exist, it is created.

Note:

If you do not specify an absolute pathname (for example, C:\Reports), the directory is assumed to be relative to the install-dir\mgr directory.

set x = $$getlogdir^SystemPerformance()

Sets variable x equal to the output directory pathname.

do clrlogdir^SystemPerformance()

Resets the output directory pathname to the default directory (install-dir\mgr).

### 13.7 Getting Version Information

You can find the current v ersion of the ^SystemPerformance utility using the following commands:

- write $$version^SystemPerformance()

- set ver=$$version^SystemPerformance()

### 13.8 Manipulating Profiles

You can use the APIs described in the following sections to manipulate the profile definitions.

- Create New Profiles

- Edit Profiles

- Copy Profiles

- Delete Profiles

#### 13.8.1 Create New Profiles

You can create a new profile with the follo wing API command:

set rc=$$addprofile^SystemPerformance("profilename","description",interval,count,,,,compress)

You must specify:

- profilename — A name for the profile, which must be unique and cannot contain spaces or whitespace characters.

- description — A description of the profile that is displayed in the ^SystemPerformance menu.

- interval — The frequency with which to run each sample, in seconds (in the range of 1 second to 300 seconds). An interval of 1 second is only allowed if the profile duration is an hour or less.

- count — The number of times to run the profile.

- compress — Specify if the report generated from this profile should be compressed, set to 1 to enable compression.

The function returns 1 if successful and 0 if unsuccessful. This is followed by a carat and then the reason for any errors.

For example, to create a profile named 2minrun that runs a sampling every 10 seconds until it runs 12 samplings (for a total
of 120 seconds, or two minutes), enter the following:

set rc=$$addprofile^SystemPerformance("2minrun","A 2-minute run sampling every 10 seconds",10,12)

The next time you run the ^SystemPerformance utility, the list of profiles includes the follo wing profile name and
description:

2minrun A 2-minute run sampling every 10 seconds

##### 13.8.1.1 Generate Profile

Alternatively, you can quickly generate new profiles (with a meaningful name and description) with the follo wing API
command:

set rc=$$genprofile^SystemPerformance("duration"[,interval])

Where:

- duration — How long the profile should run. The valid formats are "hh:mm", "hh:", or mm

- interval (optional) — The frequency with which to run each sample, in seconds (in the range of 1 second to 300 seconds). An interval of 1 second is only allowed if the profile duration is an hour or less.

The function returns 1 if successful. If unsuccessful, it returns 0 followed by a carat and the reason for any errors.

Note:

The maximum duration is 24 hours (86400 seconds); if you specify a longer duration, ^SystemPerformance
reduces it to 24 hours. The duration must be double-quoted only if it contains a colon (:); the colon denotes hours.

The minimum interval, if specified, is 2 seconds, unless the duration (that is, hour, in which case the minimum interval is 1 second. If you specify an invalid interval, ^SystemPerformance increases it to the required minimum. If the interval is not specified, it def aults to 10 seconds.

interval * count) is less than one

For example, to generate a profile named 12hours (with a generated profile name and description) that runs samples e very
## 5 minutes (300 seconds) over 12 hours, enter the following:

set rc=$$genprofile^SystemPerformance("12:",300)

In addition, to generate a profile named 90mins that runs samples every 10 seconds for 90 minutes, enter the following:

set rc=$$genprofile^SystemPerformance(90)

The next time you run the ^SystemPerformance utility, the list of profiles includes the follo wing profile names and
descriptions:

12hours 12 hour run sampling every 300 seconds 90mins A 90 minute run sampling every 10 seconds

#### 13.8.2 Edit Profiles

You can edit an existing profile (e xcept for the predefined “test” profile) with the follo wing API command:

set rc=$$editprofile^SystemPerformance("profilename","description",[interval],[count],,,,[compress])

Manipulating Profiles

Where:

- profilename — The name of the existing profile you w ant to edit.

- description — A description of the profile that is displayed in the ^SystemPerformance menu.

- interval (optional) — The frequency with which to run each sample, in seconds (in the range of 1 second to 300 seconds). An interval of 1 second is only allowed if the profile duration is an hour or less.

- count (optional) — The number of times to run the profile.

- compress (optional) — Specify if the report generated from this profile should be compressed, set to 1 to enable compression.

The function returns 1 if successful and 0 if unsuccessful. This is followed by a carat and then the reason for any errors.

Note:

The arguments are positional; if, for example, to edit the count argument (and keep the value specified in the
interval argument), you must include the comma separator, as follows: set
rc=$$editprofile^SystemPerformance("2minrun","A 5-minute run sampling every 30
seconds",,50).

If the duration exceeds 24 hours (86400 seconds), it is automatically reduced to 24 hours.

For example, to modify the 2minrun profile to run a sampling e very 30 seconds until it runs 10 samplings (for a total of 300
seconds, or fiv e minutes), enter the following:

set rc=$$editprofile^SystemPerformance("2minrun","A 5-minute run sampling every 30 seconds",30,10)

The next time you run the ^SystemPerformance utility, the list of profiles includes the follo wing profile name and
description:

2minrun A 5-minute run sampling every 30 seconds

#### 13.8.3 Copy Profiles

You can copy an existing profile to a file with a dif

ferent name with the following API command:

set rc=$$copyprofile^SystemPerformance("sourceprofilename","targetprofilename")

You must specify:

- sourceprofilename — The name of an existing profile

- targetprofilename — The name of the profile you w ant to create. This must be unique and cannot contain spaces or whitespace characters. This must be double-quoted.

The function returns 1 if successful. If unsuccessful, it returns 0 followed by a carat and the reason for any errors.

For example, to make a copy of the 2minrun profile, enter the follo wing:

set rc=$$copyprofile^SystemPerformance("2minrun","5minrun")

The next time you run the ^SystemPerformance utility, the list of profiles includes the follo wing profile names and
descriptions:

2minrun A 2-minute run sampling every 30 seconds 5minrun A 2-minute run sampling every 30 seconds

You can now edit the new profile as described in Edit Profiles .

#### 13.8.4 Delete Profiles

You can delete existing profiles (e xcept for the predefined “test” profile) with the follo wing API command:

set rc=$$delprofile^SystemPerformance("profilename")

You must specify profilename , the name of the profile you w ant to delete. This must be double-quoted.

The function returns 1 if successful. If unsuccessful, it returns 0 followed by a carat and the reason for any errors.

For example, to delete the 2minrun profile, enter the follo wing:

set rc=$$delprofile^SystemPerformance("2minrun")

The next time you run the ^SystemPerformance utility, the list of profiles does not include 2minrun profile.

### 13.9 Performance Report Details

perfmon

Description

Output from the Microsoft Windows perfmon utility.

The default presentation of Microsoft Windows perfmon data is raw format. The format can be switched to processed, which removes the repeated server name and splits the datetime column into separate columns, to improve readability.

The following functions allow the querying and updating of the flag that determines
whether the perfmon data is manipulated or not:

set rc=$$setperfmonpostproc^SystemPerformance(<onoroff>)

where onoroff can be 1 (on) or 0 (off), or the non-case-sensitive words "on" or "off".

A return code of 1 indicates successful update of the flag, 0 indicates a failed update, and -1 indicates a non-Windows platform.

To determine the current format (raw or processed):

set status=$$getperfmonpostproc^SystemPerformance()

A return code of 1 indicates processed format, 0 indicates raw format.

In addition, the current status of the flag is reported prior to the profile menu display in the interactive run of ^SystemPerformance.

By default, perfmon monitors the counter definitions specified in the default pbctrs.txt file. To monitor previously defined perfmon counters, import the defini-
tion into ^SystemPerformance using:

write $$importctrs^SystemPerformance(WindowsCtrName
[,SystemPerformanceCtrName [,SystemPerformanceFileName]])

A return code of 0 indicates success and a negative number followed by a reason string indicates failure. Duplicate SystemPerformance counter names are not allowed. If necessary, ^SystemPerformance generates both the internal counter name and file name.

To change the default SystemPerformance counter definition to an exiting defi-
nition, use:

write $$setctrdefault(SystemPerformanceCtrName)

Return code of 1 indicates success and 0 followed by a reason string indicates failure. If an invalid counter is specified, the builtin defaualt is set.

To reset the default SystemPerformance counter definition, use:

do clrctrdefault^SystemPerformance()

To associate a specific SystemPerformance counter definition with an existing
profile, use:

write $$addctrtoprofile(ProfileName,SystemPerformanceCtrName)

Return code of 1 indicates success and 0 followed by a reason string indicates failure. If either the profile or the counter definition do not exist, the command is not run.

### 13.10 See Also

- Using the Diagnostic Report

- WRC distribution site (Tools) This topic describes the ^mgstat utility, a tool for collecting basic performance data.

### 14.1 Running ^mgstat

You must call ^mgstat in the %SYS namespace. You can use the following positional arguments:

1.

sample time — This argument specifies the frequenc y (in seconds) for sampling counters. If not specified, the def ault is 2 seconds.

Note:

If you specify a sample time greater than 10 seconds, ^mgstat reduces it to 10 seconds. See the number of samples argument in this table.

2.

number of samples — This argument specifies the maximum number of samples to be obtained. If not specified, the default is 10 iterations.

Note:

If ^mgstat reduces the sample time, it increases the specified number of samples to ensure that the duration (sample time * number of samples) of the run is effectively the same as it would have been if none of the arguments were modified.

3.

4.

filename — This arguments specifies the filename for the .mgst file that ^mgstat generates, relative to install-dir\mgr. If not specified, the def ault filename is ServerName_InstanceName_Date_Time.mgst.

page length — If you run ^mgstat interactively, this argument specifies the number of lines to display before the
header rows are repeated. The default is 0, which displays the header once at the beginning of the page; if you specify
a value less than 5 lines (other than 0), ^mgstat increases it to 5.

Note:

This argument is ignored when you run ^mgstat as a background job.

For example, if running ^mgstat as a background job, to specify that file samples be obtained e very 5 seconds until 17280
samplings are obtained (in the Terminal, in the %SYS namespace), enter the following:

%SYS>JOB ^mgstat(5,17280)

Alternatively, if running ^mgstat interactively, to specify the same samplings redisplay the headings after each 10 rows
of data, enter the following:

%SYS>DO ^mgstat(5,17280,,10)

By default ^mgstat generates a filename based on the server name, configur ation name, and date and time, with the mgst extension, which is recognized by an analyzer tool written in Microsoft Excel that aids graphing of the data. By default,
install-dir\mgr directory of the InterSystems IRIS® data platform instance; however, if the output
the file is located in the directory has been changed through the ^SystemPerformance utility (see Change Output Directory), ^mgstat uses that output directory.

Note:

The .mgst file is also generated when you run the ^SystemPerformance utility and included in the HTML performance report (see Monitoring Performance Using ^SystemPerformance).

To ensure minimal impact on system performance, the ^mgstat utility extracts various counter information from shared memory. If the utility is running and an apparent performance issue occurs, data is available to help you investigate the
problem; for assistance with your analysis, contact the InterSystems Worldwide Response Center (WRC), which can provide
tasks that automate both the running of ^mgstat and the purging of files.

### 14.2 Data Provided by ^mgstat

Most of the reported data is averaged in per-second values, except as noted in the table below. The generated output file is in a readable, comma-separated value (CSV) format, which is more easily interpreted with a spreadsheet tool such as Microsoft Excel. The first line of the file is a header line which includes the filename and the utility v ersion, as well information about buffer allocation and the version of the product being monitored. The number of columns of data depends on
the version of the product: the first tw o columns are the date and time; the remaining columns are:

Column

### 14.3 Considering Seizes, ASeizes, and NSeizes

Note:

Seize statistics are included if the underlying system is collecting them; more information can be found in the
Config.Miscellaneous class; see the CollectResourceStats property.

A Seize occurs whenever a job needs exclusive access on a given resource to guarantee that an update occurs without interference from other processes. If the Seize is not immediately satisfied, the update is postponed until it is satisfied.

On a single-CPU system, the process immediately hibernates (because it cannot do anything until the process holding the resource relinquishes it, which does not occur until after its own update completes).

On a multiple-CPU system, the process enters a holding loop in the “hope” that it will gain the resource in a reasonable time, thus avoiding the expense of hibernating. If the process gets access to the resource during the hold loop, the loop
immediately exits and the process continues with its update; upon completing the update, the process relinquishes the
resource for other processes that may be waiting for it; this is an Aseize. If, at the end of the hold loop, the resource is still
held by another process, the process continues to hibernate and wait to be woken up when the resource is released; this is
an Nseize.

Nseizes are a natural consequence of running multiple processes on a single-CPU system; Aseizes are a natural consequence
of running multiple processes on a multi-CPU system. The difference is that Nseizes incur system, or privileged, CPU time because the operating system must change the context of the running process, whereas an Aseize incurs user time on the CPU because it continues to run until the resource is gained and released, or until it gives up and hibernates. In general, on multi-CPU systems it is more expensive for the operating system to do the context switch than to loop a few times to avoid this operation because there is both CPU overhead and memory latency associated with context switching on multi-CPU systems.

### 14.4 See Also

- Monitoring Performance Using ^SystemPerformance The History Monitor maintains a historical database of performance and system usage metrics. Its primary purposes are
to:

- Provide a performance baseline and help with analysis of performance issues.

- Help analyze system usage over time for capacity planning.

This database is defined in the SYS.History class package and kept in the %SYS namespace. All of the details of the database structure are published there and the data is accessible through SQL or the normal persistent object access. The class documentation in SYS.History also contains descriptions of all the individual properties, methods and queries that are available.

The data is generally organized into performance (see SYS.History.Performance) and system usage (see SYS.History.SystemUsage) data. The performance metrics are intended to be sampled at short intervals (by default, 30 seconds), and the system usage data at longer intervals (by default, 5 minutes). At the beginning of each day, the individual interval samples are summarized into hourly and daily tables as averages, maximums, minimums, standard deviation, medians and totals. You can select which, if any, of the summary functions are kept for each metric class. The interval and
hourly data may be purged automatically after a defined number of days (by def ault, seven (7) days and 60 days, respectively);
the daily summary is intended for long-term analysis and can be purged manually.

### 15.1 Base Metrics

All of the collected metrics are defined in four %SerialObject classes in SYS.History. These same classes are used as the basis for the Interval, Hourly, and Daily databases, so all of the properties are defined as %Numeric types to allow for decimal values in the summaries.

The performance related metrics are defined in:

- SYS.History.Performance — The properties in this class are general performance metrics like global references and routine calls.

- Note:

These properties are all “counter” types and the interval data is collected as deltas, which represent the change in the counter over the last interval. When this data is summarized into hourly and daily values, the data is normalized to per-second rates

SYS.History.WriteDaemon — The properties in this class describe the performance of write daemon cycles. The system automatically keeps track of the last 20 write daemon cycles, and the History Monitor stores the data for the cycles that occurred in each interval. Typically, there are multiple cycles within each interval.

The system usage metrics are defined in:

- SYS.History.SystemUsage — The properties in this class track how busy the system is but do not tend to change as quickly or dramatically as the performance data, such as the number of processes in InterSystems IRIS® data platform and license information.

- SYS.History.Database — This class tracks the database growth, file size and free space, for each local database.

### 15.2 Collecting Data

To begin collecting data, you must do the following:

- Use the System Monitor ^%SYSMONMGR utility in the %SYS namespace to activate the desired monitor classes (%Monitor.System.HistoryPerf or %Monitor.System.HistorySys) in Application Monitor (which is part of System Monitor). These classes are registered in the %SYS namespace by default.

- Restart System Monitor in the %SYS namespace.

See Using ^%SYSMONMGR to Manage Application Monitor and Start/Stop System Monitor for information about these procedures.

The detailed interval collection of data is defined in tw o persistent classes:

- SYS.History.PerfData — Includes the performance and write daemon classes as embedded objects.

- SYS.History.SysData — Includes the system usage and database classes.

The corresponding %Monitor classes must be activated in Application Monitor in order to collect data and build the history
data:

- %Monitor.System.HistoryPerf — Collects instances of SYS.History.PerfData samples.

- %Monitor.System.HistorySys — Collects SYS.History.SysData samples.

System Monitor, including Application Monitor, starts by default in the %SYS namespace when the InterSystems IRIS instance starts. You can configured other startup namespaces, ho wever. The %Monitor classes are provided by default only in %SYS, but can be added to other configured startup namespaces using ^%SYSMONMGR.

### 15.3 Summaries

The %Monitor.System.HistoryPerf and %Monitor.System.HistorySys classes, as executed by Application Monitor, also create the hourly and daily summaries at the end of each day. The summaries are defined as the persistent classes SYS.History.Hourly
and SYS.History.Daily; they include all four of the base classes as embedded objects.

For each metric property, the system may calculate the average, maximum (high-water mark), standard deviation, minimum, median, or total for each hour and for the whole day. The summary functions are selectable (or may be disabled) for each base class (SYS.History.Performance, SYS.History.WriteDaemon, SYS.History.SystemUsage, or SYS.History.Database) and for each summary period class, using the SetSummary() method of each of the base classes. By default, the History Monitor calculates average, maximum and standard deviation for each class for both hourly and daily summaries.

Note:

The counter properties of the SYS.History.Performance class are normalized to per second rates for these calculations (except Total).

Purging Data

After creating the summaries, Application Monitor automatically purges the interval and hourly databases. The default is seven (7) days for interval data and 60 days for hourly data, but these may be changed using the SetPurge() method in SYS.History.PerfData and SYS.History.Hourly classes. The SYS.History.Daily data is not automatically purged, but can be done manually using the SYS.History.Daily:Purge() method.

Accessing the Data

### 15.4 Accessing the Data

Since the database is defined as persistent classes, the data is a vailable using standard SQL or persistent object access. Using the SQL browser in the Management Portal is a quick and easy way to see the various SQL schemas/tables that are created, including the individual property values.

There are several basic queries implemented in each of the persistent classes in SYS.History (SYS.History.PerfData, SYS.History.SysData, SYS.History.Hourly, and SYS.History.Daily) that can be used to access the individual tables for a date
range; for more information about the queries, see the class reference documentation.

The are also several Export() methods provided for each persistent class so that the individual tables can be exported to files in CSV format, suitable for use with a spreadsheet such as Microsoft Excel. In particular , the SYS.History.PerfData:Export() method creates a file that is v ery similar in format to that created by the ^mgstat utility (for more information, see Monitoring Performance Using ^mgstat).

### 15.5 Adding User-Defined Metrics

You can add user-defined metrics to the History Monitor ( SYS.History package):

1. Create a class, or multiple classes, that inherit from SYS.History.Adaptor and add %Numeric properties to define the

metrics.

Note:

User-written classes must be in the %SYS namespace, and should begin with “Z” or “z” to prevent naming conflicts with system classes and problems during upgrades.

2. Code the Sample() method to instantiate the class and provide periodic values for each property. This method is called

when the interval data is collected.

3. When you compile your class, it is added as an embedded object to an interval persistent class in SYS.History. You

can choose where and when it is collected using the INTERVAL parameter provided in SYS.History.Adaptor class. This
selects which interval class it is added to and which %Monitor class does the collection, as shown in the following table:

INTERVAL Selected

Interval Class Used

%Monitor Class Used

“User” (default)

SYS.History.User

%Monitor.System.HistoryUser

“UserPerf”

“UserSys”

SYS.History.UserPerf

%Monitor.System.HistoryPerf

SYS.History.UserSys

%Monitor.System.HistorySys

Selecting “UserPerf” or “UserSys ” lets you collect data at the same interval and with the same timestamp as SYS.History.PerfData or SYS.History.SysData, which makes it easier to correlate your data with the system data. “User” gives you a choice of a third (unrelated) time interval.

Note:

There are several parameters in the SYS.History.Adaptor class that provide options for how properties are
collected and summarized; for more information, see the SYS.History.Adaptor class reference documentation.

4. User-defined classes are also added as embedded objects to the SYS.History.UserHourly and SYS.History.UserDaily
summary classes. The user-defined metrics are summarized and automatically pur ged just like the system metrics.

Important:

User-defined metric classes become embedded objects in persistent data. You should not change def-
initions after data collection has started: deleting objects can result in orphaned data; re-defining
existing classes or properties can cause already stored data to be misinterpreted.

However, because of the schema evolution feature, you can safely add new objects and properties. See Schema Evolution.

Monitoring Block Collisions Using
^BLKCOL

A block collision occurs when a process is forced to wait for access to a block. Excessive block collisions slow application performance. This page describes how to monitor block collisions by using the ^BLKCOL utility.

### 16.1 Using ^BLKCOL

In InterSystems IRIS® data platform, the ^BLKCOL utility samples block collisions over a specified period (10 seconds by default), recording the latest block collision within a specified interv al (10 milliseconds by default) during this time. For each recorded collision, ^BLKCOL identifies not only the block, b ut the global involved and its first and last references in the block, as well as the routine and line that created the process attempting to access the block.

Note:

The irisstat -D option, as described in Running irisstat with Options, also samples block collisions, but identifies only the blocks involved.

The output of irisstat -D is included in the reports generated by the ^SystemPerformance utility, as described in Monitoring Performance Using ^SystemPerformance.

When running ^BLKCOL, you can specify the following:

- The length of the sampling period in seconds

- The interval between samples in milliseconds

- Whether to collect routine details (default is yes)

- Whether to format the output as:

–

–

–

–

–

a list of the blocks with the highest collision counts (default)

a list of all blocks involved in collisions

comma-separated values from all block collisions detected, sorted and counted by block number and routine

comma-separated values from all block collisions detected, unsorted (raw)

a list of collision hot spots in routines

- the number of blocks to display (if applicable)

- whether to send output to a file Monitoring Block Collisions Using ^BLKCOL

Monitoring Processes Using
^PERFSAMPLE

This topic describes the ^PERFSAMPLE utility, a tool for analyzing InterSystems IRIS® data platform processes.

The utility performs high frequency sampling of selected processes on the system, and analyzes the data to determine where the processes are spending most of their time. It presents an easily navigable breakdown of the sampled activity, which can provide insights into your system. For example, you may discover application bottlenecks by checking ECP requests, or identify overall system bottlenecks by reviewing the types of wait events.

To get started, run ^PERFSAMPLE in the %SYS namespace:

Terminal

USER>set $namespace = "%SYS"

%SYS>do ^PERFSAMPLE

### 17.1 Collecting Samples

The following message appears as soon as you run ^PERFSAMPLE:

Terminal

This utility performs high frequency sampling of processes on the system, analyzing and counting data points in different ways to understand where processes are spending most of their time. On ECP Data Servers, this also offers sampling of the current request being processed and the states of the ECPSvrW daemons doing the processing.

1) Sample Local Process Activity 2) Sample ECP Server Requests

Option?

If the instance has no incoming ECP connections from ECP clients (application servers), option 1 above is automatically selected.

Then specify the following information at the prompts:

1. Specify the processes or ECP connections to sample.

- If you are sampling local processes, the prompt looks like this:

Enter a list of PIDs (comma separated), * for all, or ? for ^%SS display.

If you enter ?, the routine displays information on all the currently running processes, with the process ID in the
first column, as in the follo wing partial example:

Process Device Namespace Routine CPU,Glob Pr User/Location ...

- If you are sampling ECP connections, the routine first lists the a vailable connections alphabetically (with connection
numbers) as in the following example, and then prompts for input:

The following clients are connected:
Conn# Client
9: DBSVR:APP1:IRIS
10: DBSVR:APP2:IRIS
2: DBSVR:APP3:IRIS
1: DBSVR:APP4:IRIS
4: DBSVR:APP5:IRIS

Enter *, list of connection numbers (comma separated) or clients.

For ECP connections, you can enter * to select all, a connection number, a client name, or a comma-separated list of connection numbers and/or client names.

For a given client name, you can specify the fully qualified name, lik e MYSVR:MYAPPHOST1:IRIS, or — if any of those three pieces are sufficient to uniquely identify the connection (as is typically true of the client host name in the middle piece) — then you can abbreviate the name to just that piece.

2. Specify whether to ignore samples where the process is in any of the following states: READ, READW, EVTW, HANG,

SLCT, SLCTW, and RUNW. When sampling ECP connections, only events where the ECPSvrW process is non-idle are recorded.

Selecting YES (the default) reduces the number of events that ^PERFSAMPLE records. When monitoring many processes, this speeds analysis and uses less memory.

3. Specify the number of samples to collect per second.

4. Specify the total number of seconds to collect samples.

The following shows an example:

Terminal

Enter a list of PIDs, * for all, or ? for ^%SS display: * Ignore samples where the process appears idle (READ, HANG, etc)?
Yes =>
Sample rate per second: 1000 => Number of seconds to sample: 30 =>

### 17.2 Examining and Analyzing Samples

After collecting the samples, you may view an analysis. An analysis is a summary of one or more dimensions, or components, of the sampled processes. That is, an analysis sorts the sampled information according to the selected dimensions.

This section includes the following:

- An example of using a predefined analyses .

- Information about creating a custom analyses.

- A description of the available analysis dimensions.

Use the following keys to navigate within the analyzer:

#### 17.2.1 Predefined Analysis Example

Below is an example of an analysis that begins with the Process State dimension.

In this example, ^PERFSAMPLE found 76755 samples of processes in a sample-able state (non-idle if the option to
ignore idle was selected) out of 319994 total samples:

Terminal

– PERFSAMPLE for Local Process Activity. 3.89s at 11/17/2020 16:59:59
## 76755 events in 319994 samples [24.0 %-total] | CPULoad* 8.22 Multiple jobs included: 2191 samples per job
----------------------------'?' for help---------------------------- Process State [24.0 %-total] GGET [8.46 %-total] RUN [5.88 %-total] GDEF [3.16 %-total] GSETW [1.63 %-total] BSETW [1.21 %-total] GDEFW [1.18 %-total] GGETW [0.931 %-total] SEMW [0.685 %-total] GSET [0.311 %-total] LOCKW [0.144 %-total] LOCK [0.0644 %-total] INCRW [0.0641 %-total] BSET [0.0513 %-total]

Initially, the values appear as a percent of the total number of samples. The most common Process State value sampled in this case was GGET, which represents 8.46% of the total 319994 samples.

Pressing c cycles through how this count is displayed. For example, you can display the above information as a raw count
of samples:

Terminal

Process State [76755] > GGET [27083] RUN [18823] GDEF [10121]

You can also view the information as a percent of qualifying samples (in this case, samples that had a non-idle Process
State):

Terminal

Process State [24.0 %-total] > GGET [35.3 %-subset] RUN [24.5 %-subset] GDEF [13.2 %-subset]

Finally, you can view the average number of jobs concurrently each state:

Terminal

Process State [24.0 %-total] GGET [12.4 jobs] RUN [8.59 jobs] GDEF [4.62 jobs]

Selecting GGET with the Right Arrow key moves to the next dimension, ordering the values of that dimension for samples where the first dimension had v alue GGET. You can navigate freely between the dimensions using the arrow keys.

#### 17.2.2 Creating a Custom Analysis

Select the New Analysis option from the main landing page to create a custom analysis. You can also create an custom
analysis using one of these shortcuts:

Adding a new analysis brings you to the following screen:

Terminal

New Analysis:

Specify a comma-delimited list of dimensions upon which to analyze samples. For example, "state,ns,rou" means first count each unique state the sampled
processes were in; then for each state, count the namespace from the samples
in that state; and finally for each state->namespace pair, count each unique
routine name. In other words, report on routines by namespace by state.

The following dimensions are available:
cpu - Using CPU? (process state indicates expected CPU use) ns - Namespace (current namespace) pid - PID (process ID) rou - Routine (name of current routine) state - Process State (process state string, e.g. GSETW) trace - Kernel Trace (alternative to 'state' w/ kernel-level detail) waits - Kernel Wait State (kernel-level condition that delayed the process) wtrace - Reverse Kernel Trace (revese kernel trace, stop at any wait state)

Enter dimension list:

From here, enter the list of dimensions you would like to analyze as described by the prompt. Once you press Enter, you may navigate the analysis as described above.

#### 17.2.3 Analysis Dimensions

The dimensions for analyses are described within the ^PERFSAMPLE tool. This section provides some additional information.

- cpu - Using CPU? (process state indicates expected CPU use)

Note:

The yes or no value for cpu is not a true measure of on-cpu time, but an estimate. ^PERFSAMPLE infers CPU use from the process state, and InterSystems IRIS state tracking may not directly correlate to CPU use.

If the process is waiting for the OS scheduler to make the CPU available to it as a result of (instantaneous or persistent) over-utilization of the CPU, this can also lead to inaccuracy in cpu.

- ns - Namespace (current namespace)

- pid - PID (process ID)

- rou - Routine (name of current routine)

- state - Process State (process state string, e.g. GSETW)

- waits - Kernel Wait State (kernel-level condition that delayed the process). See the following section for more information.

In general, the following dimensions are only useful when troubleshooting with the InterSystems Worldwide Response
Center (WRC):

- trace - Kernel Trace (alternative to 'state' w/ kernel-level detail)

- wtrace - Reverse Kernel Trace (revese kernel trace, stop at any wait state) The trace and wtrace dimensions have a hierarchical organization. Selecting an ancestor, denoted with an ellipsis (...), moves down a hierarchy level. Selecting a non-ancestral item goes to the next dimension of analysis. The h key toggles between this hierarchical view and a flattened vie w. Pressing the a key on an ancestor aggregates subsequent dimensions for all its descendants.

##### 17.2.3.1 The waits Dimension

The waits dimension is null if the process was not found to be waiting on anything internal to the InterSystems IRIS kernel. A non-null value indicates a condition which required the process to wait (to block internally).

It's important to note that these are internal conditions leading to the process waiting outside of the application's direct
control. As such, waiting due to a conflicting LOCK command, a $SYSTEM.Event, and the like do not count here.

Nonetheless, many of the values, particularly the more common ones, are things that the application can influence indirectly . For example, if samples show that a key application process is often waiting for diskio, this indicates that the process is waiting to read database blocks from disk and could possibly benefit from parallelization, prefetching, or more database cache. Similarly, a process that samples show is often waiting on inusebufwt is encountering database block collisions that may need investigation at the application level (with the help of the ^BLKCOL utility). The values in this dimension
take on the following mnemonic values, which are subject to change in the future:

- diskio: waiting for database physical block read

- inusebufwt: waiting due to block collision (^BLKCOL utility may help identify application cause)

- expand: waiting for database expansion

- ecpwait: waiting for an answer from the ECP server

- jrniowait: no space in journal buffers, waiting for journal I/O

- jrnsyncblk: waiting for journal data to be committed

- jrnlckwait: waiting to access journal buffer

- mirrorwait: waiting for active backup mirror member

- mirrortrouble: blocked due to mirror trouble state

- globwait: waiting because of an internal condition blocking global updates

- aiowait: waiting for asynchronous disk I/O to complete

- wdqwait: waiting for a write cycle to complete

- freebuf: global buffers are completely exhausted and waiting for database writes

- gfownwait: access to database is blocked

- resenqXYZ: waiting on an internal resource XYZ Note: While many of these correspond to a canonical process state that includes the W letter flag (e.g. GSETW, GORDW, etc) and not all do – diskio is a very common example – and not all cases of the W state flag ha ve an internal reason reflected here (e.g. LOCKW as mentioned above).

### 17.3 Save Analysis

After viewing the samples, you may save them for future analysis. To do so, press the Left Arrow from the analysis landing page. This returns you to the initial Collecting Samples page, but with the additional option to Save Samples to File.

Select this option and enter the desired filename, such as perfsample001.txt. ^PERFSAMPLE saves the file to the install-dir\mgr directory.

To open a saved analysis, launch ^PERFSAMPLE using the LOAD tag and specify the file to open. F or example:

Terminal

USER>set $namespace = "%SYS"

%SYS>do LOAD^PERFSAMPLE

File: C:\MyIRIS\mgr\perfsample001.txt

^PERFSAMPLE loads the file, allo wing you to analyze and examine the saved samples.

- Controlling InterSystems IRIS Processes (general information on InterSystems processes)

- ^BLKCOL utility (for monitoring block collisions, which occur when a process is forced to wait for access to a block) InterSystems IRIS® supports structured logging.

InterSystems IRIS creates multiple logs, each for different purposes. Customers who have migrated from previous products can take advantage of these logs as in the past, but now it is also possible to channel all the log information into a single, central, machine-readable log file — a structured log. Then you can use this file with third-party analysis tools.

This page provides an overview of the information in the structured log, shows examples of the log, and describes how to enable structured logging.

Note:

If you are using a monitoring tool which is compatible with OpenTelemetry, InterSystems IRIS can transmit the information which would be available in the structured log as OTLP/HTTP signals instead. In that case, it is not necessary to enable structured logging.

### 18.1 Information Available in the Structured Log

In InterSystems IRIS, when you enable structured logging, the system writes the same data to the structured log that it also writes to the other log (whichever that is). For example, the system writes the same lines to messages.log and to the structured log.

When you have enabled structured logging, the structured log can contain the following information:

- The information that is written to messages.log. This includes alerts that require attention, information about the system startup and shutdown, high-level information about journal files and WIJ files, information about configuration changes (the CPF), and information related to licensing. See Monitoring InterSystems IRIS Logs.

- The information that is written to the audit database (assuming the minimum log Level is set to INFO or lower). The details depend on which events you are auditing. See Auditing Guide.

WARNING!

Depending on the events enabled, audit data can include PII/PHI or other sensitive data. In particular, %DirectMode and %SQL event types are more likely to contain this data. To exclude this data, you can either change the log level to WARN or higher, disable the events, or filter them with the Event
Filter.

### 18.2 Example Output

This section shows example output from the structured logging utility for name/value pair format and JSON format.

#### 18.2.1 Name/Value Pairs

The following output uses the format option NVP (name/value pairs). This sample was edited for display purposes; in the
actual output, each entry takes only a single line, and there are no blank lines between entries.

In this format, each line in the file is a JSON object with a set of properties. The names of the properties (and the values contained in the properties) are the same as listed for the name/value pairs in the previous section.

### 18.3 Configure Structured Logging

You can configure structured logging using the management portal, the ^LOGDMN routine, or the class-based API SYS.LogDmn in the %SYS namespace.

#### 18.3.1 Using the Management Portal

The management portal lets you manage structured logging on the System > Configuration > System Configuration > Log Daemon Configuration page. On this page you can see the current status of the log daemon. This status updates every 500
ms. You can also edit the log daemon settings for the instance. The available settings are detailed below:

Enabled

Determines whether the log daemon is enabled or not. YES if enabled or NO if not enabled.

Child Process Launch Command

The pipe command, which specifies where the system will send the structured log. Enter a response of the follo wing
form:

irislogd -f c:/myfilename.log

But replace c:/myfilename .log with the fully qualified path name of the destination log file. In this command, irislogd is the name of an InterSystems executable file that will recei ve the log data and write it to the specified file (via the -f option).

For the pipe command, the easiest option is to use the executable mentioned here (irislogd.exe), but you can substitute a different target. For other options for irislogd.exe, see the last section.

Level

Format

Interval

The minimum log level, one of the following:

- DEBUG2 — detailed debug messages (such as hex dumps).

- DEBUG— less detailed debug messages.

- INFO — informational messages, including all audit events.

- WARN (the default) — warnings, which indicate problems that may need attention but that have not disrupted operations.

- SEVERE — severe errors, which indicate problems that have disrupted operations.

- FATAL — fatal errors, which indicate problems have caused the system to stop running.

The format of the data sent to the pipe. Can be NVP or JSON.

The interval in seconds between successive calls to the pipe command. The default is 10 seconds.

Event Filter

The optional filter restricts e vents in the structured log based on event type. Filter patterns can be specified in the
following format:

Configure Structured Logging

+<pattern>: Include events matching <pattern> -<pattern>: Exclude events matching <pattern> <pattern>: Default include (equivalent to +<pattern>)

Consider the following syntactical rules when specifying filter patterns:

- Use a period (.) as a separator for hierarchical names, such as A.B.C

- Use an asterisk (*) as a wildcard only at the end of patterns, such as A.B.*, which includes all sub-events
under A.B

- Use a comma (,) to separate multiple filter patterns, such as -A,A.B

Reference the following examples when formulating event filters:

- -Audit.*,Audit.LoginFailure

- Excludes all Audit events except LoginFailure.

-*,+Log.Started

Excludes all events except Log.Started .

Events not specified in the filter are included. Specific rules tak patterns have higher priority. For example, -A.B.C has a higher priority than +A.

e precedence over wildcard rules, and more detailed

#### 18.3.2 Using the ^LOGDMN

The ^LOGDMN routine lets you manage structured logging.

To use ^LOGDMN to enable structured logging:

1. Open the Terminal and enter the following commands:

set $namespace="%sys"
do ^LOGDMN

This starts a routine with the following prompts:

1) Enable logging 2) Disable logging 3) Display configuration 4) Edit configuration 5) Set default configuration 6) Display logging status 7) Start logging 8) Stop logging 9) Restart logging

LOGDMN option?

2. Press 4 so that you can specify the configuration details. The routine then prompts you for the following items:

a. The minimum log level, one of the following:

- DEBUG2 — detailed debug messages (such as hex dumps).

- DEBUG— less detailed debug messages.

- INFO — informational messages, including all audit events.

- WARN (the default) — warnings, which indicate problems that may need attention but that have not disrupted operations.

- SEVERE — severe errors, which indicate problems that have disrupted operations.

- FATAL — fatal errors, which indicate problems have caused the system not to run.

b. The pipe command, which specifies where the system will send the structured log. Enter a response of the follo wing

form:

irislogd -f c:/myfilename.log

But replace c:/myfilename .log with the fully qualified path name of the destination log file. In this command, irislogd is the name of an InterSystems executable file that will recei ve the log data and write it to the specified file (via the -f option).

For the pipe command, the easiest option is to use the executable mentioned here (irislogd.exe), but you can substitute a different target. For other options for irislogd.exe, see the last section.

c. The format of the data sent to the pipe. Specify either NVP (the default) or JSON. The option NVP sends data that consists of name-value pairs, separated by spaces. The option JSON sends data in JSON output. See Example
Output.

d. The interval in seconds between successive calls to the pipe command. The default is 10 seconds.

e. The event filter , which restricts events in the structured log based on event type. Filter patterns can be specified

in the following format:

+<pattern>: Include events matching <pattern> -<pattern>: Exclude events matching <pattern> <pattern>: Default include (equivalent to +<pattern>)

Consider the following syntactical rules when specifying filter patterns:

- Use a period (.) as a separator for hierarchical names, such as A.B.C

- Use an asterisk (*) as a wildcard only at the end of patterns, such as A.B.*, which includes all sub-events
under A.B

- Use a comma (,) to separate multiple filter patterns, such as -A,A.B

For example:

-Audit.*,Audit.LoginFailure

Excludes all Audit events except LoginFailure.

3. When the routine displays the main prompt again (LOGDMN option?), press 1 to enable logging.

4. Press 7 to start logging.

#### 18.3.3 Using the Class-Based API

To manage structured logging, you can use the class SYS.LogDmn in the %SYS namespace instead of using the management portal or the ^LOGDMN routine. For details, see the class reference.

### 18.4 Other Options of irislogd

When you invoke the irislogd.exe executable via ^LOGDMN, you can pass the following arguments to the executable:

Argument

-d

-e errfilename

-f logfilename

-h hostname

Purpose

Emit diagnostic and error messages

Write errors and diagnostic messages to the given file.

Write log messages to the given file.

Includes the given host name in the structured log file.

-i irisinstance

Includes the given instance name in the structured log file.

-s

Write log messages to the Unix® syslog facility (Unix® only)

Also, you can write the output to stdout. To do on Unix, omit both -f and -s arguments. To do so on Windows, omit the -s argument.

A

This topic describes the interface between InterSystems IRIS® data platform and SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol). SNMP is a communication protocol that has gained widespread acceptance as a method of managing TCP/IP networks, including individual network devices, and computer devices in general. Its popularity has expanded its use as the underlying structure and protocol for many enterprise management tools. This is its main importance to InterSystems IRIS: a standard way to provide management and monitoring information to a wide variety of management tools.

SNMP is both a standard message format and a standard set of definitions for managed objects. It also pro vides a standard structure for adding custom-managed objects, a feature that InterSystems IRIS uses to define its management information for use by other applications.

A.1 Using SNMP with InterSystems IRIS

SNMP defines a client-serv er relationship where the client (a network management application) connects to a server program (called the SNMP agent) which executes on a remote network device or a computer system. The client requests and receives
information from that agent. There are four basic types of SNMP messages:

- GET – fetch the data for a specific managed object

- GETNEXT – get data for the next managed object in a hierarchical tree, allowing system managers to walk through all the data for a device SET – set the value for a specific managed object

TRAP – an asynchronous alert sent by the managed device or system

- The SNMP MIB (Management Information Base) contains definitions of the managed objects. Each de vice publishes a file, also referred to as its MIB, which defines which portion of the standard MIB it supports, along with an y custom definitions of managed objects. For InterSystems IRIS, this is the ISC-IRIS.mib file, located in the

- install-dir\SNMP directory.

A.2 InterSystems IRIS as a Subagent

The SNMP client connects to the SNMP agent which is listening on a well-known address, port 161. Since the client expects to connect on this particular port, there can only be one SNMP agent on a computer system. To allow access to multiple applications on the system, developers can implement master agents, which may be extended or connected to multiple subagents. InterSystems has implemented the InterSystems IRIS SNMP interface as a subagent, designed to communicate through an SNMP master agent.

Most operating systems that InterSystems IRIS supports provide an SNMP master agent which is extensible in some way to support multiple subagents. Many of these agents, however, implement their extensibility in a proprietary and incompatible manner. InterSystems IRIS implements its subagent using the Agent Extensibility (AgentX) protocol, an IETF-proposed standard as described in RFC 2741.

Some of the standard SNMP master agents support AgentX. If the SNMP master agent supplied by an operating system is not AgentX-compatible, you can replace it with the public domain Net-SNMP agent.

Note:

The exception is the Windows standard agent which does not support AgentX and for which the Net-SNMP version may not be adequate. For this exception, InterSystems supplies a Windows extension agent DLL, iscsnmp.dll, which handles the connection between the standard Windows SNMP service extension API and the InterSystems IRIS AgentX server.

A.3 Managing SNMP in InterSystems IRIS

Since SNMP is a standard protocol, the management of the InterSystems IRIS subagent is minimal. The most important task is to verify that the SNMP master agent on the system is compatible with the Agent Extensibility (AgentX) protocol (see InterSystems IRIS as a Subagent) and it is active and listening for connections on the standard AgentX TCP port 705. On Windows systems, the system automatically installs a DLL to connect with the standard Windows SNMP service. Verify that the Windows SNMP service is installed and started either automatically or manually.

Important:

Some SNMP master agents, notably Net-SNMP on Linux, do not enable AgentX by default and do not use TCP port 705 by default once they are enabled. For Net-SNMP you must modify the snmpd.conf file to enable communications with the InterSystems IRIS subagent. Recent versions of Net-SNMP also implement VACM (View-based Access Control Model) security and, by default, only allow access to the
mib-2.system subtree; the InterSystems IRIS subagent starts and runs without error, but no SNMP requests
are forwarded to InterSystems IRIS. You must expand the “views” defined in snmpd.conf to include the InterSystems IRIS MIB subtree.

Next, enable the monitoring service using the following steps:

1. Navigate to the Services page in the Management Portal (System Administration > Security > Services).

2. Click the %Service_Monitor service.

3. Select the Service enabled check box and click Save.

4. Return to the list of services page and ensure that the %Service_Monitor service is enabled.

Finally, configure the InterSystems IRIS SNMP subagent to start automatically at InterSystems IRIS startup using the fol-
lowing steps:

1. Navigate to the Monitor Settings page in the Management Portal (System Administration > Configuration > Additional

Settings > Monitor).

2. Select Yes for the Start SNMP Agent at System Startup setting and click Save.

3. When you edit this setting, the InterSystems IRIS end of the SNMP interface immediately stops and starts.

You can also start and stop the InterSystems IRIS SNMP subagent manually or programmatically using the ^SNMP routine:

Do start^SNMP(<port>,<timeout>)
Do stop^SNMP

where <port> is the TCP port for the connection (default is 705) and <timeout> is the TCP port read timeout value (default is 20 seconds). Until the <timeout> value is reached, InterSystems IRIS logs any problems encountered while establishing a connection or answering requests in the SNMP.LOG file in the

install-dir\mgr directory.

Note: When the SNMP master agent is restarted, it may be necessary to manually restart the InterSystems IRIS SNMP

subagent using the ^SNMP routine, as described in the foregoing.

SNMP Troubleshooting

A.4 SNMP Troubleshooting

The InterSystems IRIS subagent (running the ^SNMP routine) depends on the correct installation and configuration of the SNMP master agent supplied by the operating system. As noted in InterSystems IRIS as a Subagent, there are two main
ways in which the ^SNMP routine communicates with this master agent:

- Primarily, ^SNMP uses the AgentX protocol on TCP port 705.

- On Windows, ^SNMP uses a Windows extension agent DLL installed as iscsnmp.dll.

Detailed instructions for configuring the SNMP agent should be supplied with the operating system, and system managers should take some time to understand how to do this. The following are some basic guidelines and tips for troubleshooting if problems are encountered in getting InterSystems IRIS to communicate with the SNMP agent.

A.4.1 All Systems

- Make sure the SNMP agent is working independently of InterSystems IRIS and you can at least query the

mib-2.system tree for general system information. If this fails, on Windows check the Windows SNMP Service;
on UNIX®/Linux see if the SNMP daemon (snmpd) is running.

- If you can successfully query the SNMP system information but not the InterSystems IRIS MIB, then check for a
background process in InterSystems IRIS running the ^SNMP routine. Try starting it using the $$start^SNMP()
function. If the routine starts but does not continue running, check for errors in the messages.log and SNMP.log log files in the InterSystems IRIS Windows\System32\snmpdbg.log (on a 64–bit Windows system, the file is in the SysWOW64 subdirectory).

install-dir/mgr directory. On Windows, iscsnmp.dll logs any errors it encounters in

- Make sure the InterSystems IRIS %Service_Monitor service is enabled.

- More information can be logged to the SNMP.log file if you set ^SYS(“MONITOR”,”SNMP”,”DEBUG”)=1 in the %SYS namespace and restart the ^SNMP InterSystems IRIS subagent process. This logs details about each message received and sent.

A.4.2 Windows Systems

- Not all Windows versions install the Windows SNMP service by default. You may need to do this as an additional step. Make sure the Security tab of the Properties dialog for the service has at least a public community with READ rights. To send SNMP traps, you must define a Community Name and Destination on the Trap tab of the properties dialog.

- InterSystems IRIS expects the SNMP service to be installed before you install InterSystems IRIS, so it can add iscsnmp.dll to the proper Registry keys. Once InterSystems IRIS is installed, the SNMP service must be restarted so that it properly loads iscsnmp.dll and can find and communicate with the ne w InterSystems IRIS instance.

Note:

If InterSystems IRIS is installed before the SNMP service, iscsnmp.dll cannot be properly registered, and
you must use the set myStatus=$$Register^SNMP() function to do this after the Windows SNMP service
is installed. Once this is done the SNMP service must be restarted.

- On Windows, the $$start^SNMP() function only signals the SNMP service, and the InterSystems IRIS ^SNMP process
is actually started by a callback from the SNMP service into InterSystems IRIS. It may take a few seconds for the process to start, and a few more seconds before it can respond to queries.

A.4.3 UNIX® Systems

Many UNIX operating systems (IBM AIX®) do not support the AgentX protocol at this time. If your system does not support AgentX, you must install a separate SNMP agent which supports AgentX, such as Net-SNMP.

A.4.4 Linux and macOS with Net-SNMP

- AgentX support is not enabled by default, and the default port is not 705. You must modify the snmpd.conf file and add master agentx and agentXSocket TCP:localhost:705, or use snmpd -x TCP:localhost:705 on the command line.

- Basic system information like syslocation, syscontact and sysservices must be defined in snmpd.conf to enable successful startup of the snmpd daemon.

- Recent versions of Net-SNMP also implement VACM (View-based Access Control Model) security and, by default,
allow access to the mib-2.system subtree only; as a result, the InterSystems IRIS subagent starts and runs without
error, but no SNMP requests are forwarded to InterSystems IRIS. You must expand the “views” defined in snmpd.conf to include the InterSystems IRIS MIB subtree.

- To send SNMP traps, you must define a destination using the trapsink parameter in snmpd.conf, for example trapsink
##### 192.16.61.36 public.

A.5 InterSystems IRIS MIB Structure

All of the managed object data available through the InterSystems IRIS SNMP interface is defined in the InterSystems IRIS MIB file, ISC-IRIS.mib, which is located in the install-dir\SNMP directory. Typically an SNMP management application must load the MIB file for the managed application to understand and appropriately display the information. Since this procedure varies among applications, consult your management application documentation for the appropriate way to load the InterSystems IRIS MIB.

The specific data defined in the InterSystems IRIS MIB is documented in the file itself and, therefore, is not repeated here. However, it may be valuable to understand the overall structure of the InterSystems IRIS MIB tree, especially as it relates to multiple instances on the same system.

Note:

The best way to view the MIB tree is to load the MIB into a management application or MIB browser. These tools display the MIB as a tree with object IDs (OIDs), matching text representations of the objects, and descriptions of the objects.

SNMP defines the Structure of Management Information (SMI), a specific, hierarchical tree structure for all managed objects, which is detailed in RFC 1155. Each managed object is named by a unique object identifier (OID), which is written as a sequence of integers separated by periods, for example: 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1. The MIB translates this dotted integer identifier into a te xt name.

InterSystems IRIS MIB Structure

The standard SNMP MIB defines man y standard managed objects. To define application-specific e
MIB, as InterSystems IRIS does, an application uses the enterprise branch which is defined as:

xtensions to the standard

iso.org.dod.internet.private.enterprises (1.3.6.1.4.1)

The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) assigns each organization a private enterprise number as the next level in the hierarchy. For InterSystems IRIS this is 16563, which represents intersystems.

Below this, InterSystems IRIS implements its enterprise private subtree as follows:

- The level below intersystems is the “product” or application ID level. For InterSystems IRIS this is .4 (iscIris). This serves as the MIB module identity.

- The next level is the “object ” level, which separates data objects from notifications. F or InterSystems IRIS, these are .1 (irisObjects) and .2 (irisTraps). By convention, the intersystems tree uses a brief lowercase prefix added to all data objects and notification names. F or InterSystems IRIS this is iris.

- The next level is the “table” or group level. All data objects are organized into tables, even if there is only one instance or “row” to the table. This serves to organize the management data objects into groups. This is also necessary to support multiple InterSystems IRIS instances on one machine. All tables use the InterSystems IRIS instance name as the first inde x of the table. The tables may also have one or more additional indexes.

- The next level, which is always .1, is the “conceptual row” for the table (as required by the SNMP SMI).

- Finally, the individual data objects contained in that table, including any that are designated as indexes.

- The notifications (traps) are defined as indi information, see InterSystems IRIS SNMP Traps.

- vidual entries at the same hierarchical level as the “table”. For more InterSystems IRIS-specific auxiliary objects sent via notifications (traps) are defined as indi hierarchical level as the “table” . For more information, see InterSystems IRIS SNMP Traps.

vidual entries at the same

For example, encode the size of a database as:

1.3.6.1.4.1.16563.4.1.3.1.6.4.84.69.83.84.1

This translates to:

iso.org.dod.internet.private.enterprises.intersystems.isciris.irisObjects irisDBTab.irisDBRow.irisDBSize.TEST(instname).1(DBindex)

A.5.1 Extending the InterSystems IRIS MIB

Application programmers can add managed object definitions and e xtend the MIB for which the InterSystems IRIS subagent
provides data. This is not intended to be a complete MIB editor or SNMP toolkit; rather, it is a way to add simple application
metrics that you can browse or query through SNMP.

Note:

The objects must follow the basic InterSystems IRIS SNMP structure, there is limited support for SNMP table structures (only integer-valued indexes are supported), and SNMP traps are not created (see the %Monitor.Alert class). A basic understanding of SNMP structure of management information is helpful.

To create these objects do the following:

1. Create InterSystems IRIS object definitions in classes that inherit from the %Monitor.Adaptor class. See the InterSystems

Class Reference for details about adding managed objects to the %Monitor package.

2. Execute an SNMP class method to enable these managed objects in SNMP and create a MIB definition file for man-

agement applications to use. The method to accomplish this is MonitorTools.SNMP.CreateMIB().

See the MonitorTools.SNMP class documentation for details of the CreateMIB() method parameters.

The method creates a branch of the private enterprise MIB tree for a specific application defined in the %Monitor database. In addition to creating the actual MIB file for the application, the method also creates an internal outline of the MIB tree. The InterSystems IRIS subagent uses this to register the MIB subtree, walk the tree for GETNEXT requests, and reference specific objects methods for g athering the instance data in GET requests.

All the managed object definitions use the same general or ganization as the InterSystems IRIS enterprise MIB tree, that is: application.objects.table.row.item.indices. The first inde x for all tables is the InterSystems IRIS application ID. All applications must register with the IANA to obtain their own private enterprise number, which is one of the parameters in the CreateMIB() method.

To disable the application in SNMP, use the MonitorTools.SNMP.DeleteMIB() method. This deletes the internal outline of the application MIB, so the InterSystems IRIS subagent no longer registers or answers requests for that private enterprise MIB subtree.

For an example of defining a user Monitor class, see Sample User-Defined SNMP Monitor Class .

A.5.2 InterSystems IRIS SNMP Traps

In addition to the object data and metrics available through SNMP queries, InterSystems IRIS can send asynchronous alerts or SNMP traps. The following table describes the InterSystems IRIS-specific SNMP traps.

Table I–1: InterSystems IRIS SNMP Notification Objects (Traps)

A.6 Sample User-Defined SNMP Monitor Class

This section describes an example of how to define a user Application Monitor class (see Application Monitor) that you can query via SNMP. The Application Monitor includes only properties with %Monitor data types in the SNMP data.

Example Sample Class

The following is the sample class for this example:

Class Definition

Class SNMP.Example Extends %Monitor.Adaptor
{

/// Give the application a name. This allows you to group different
/// classes together under the same application level in the SNMP MIB.
/// The default is the same as the Package name.
Parameter APPLICATION = "MyApp";

/// This groups a set of properties together at the "table" level of the
/// SNMP MIB hierarchy. The default is the Class name.
Parameter GROUPNAME = "MyTable";

/// An integer metric counter
Property Counter1 As %Monitor.Integer;

/// Another integer metric counter
Property Counter2 As %Monitor.Integer;

/// A status indicator as a string data type
Property Status As %Monitor.String;

/// The method is REQUIRED. It is where the Application Monitor
/// calls to collect data samples, which then get picked up by the
/// ^SNMP server process when requested.
Method GetSample() As %Status
{
set ..Counter1=$r(200)
set ..Counter2=200+$r(100)
set n=$r(4)
set ..Status=$s(n=1:"Crashed",n=2:"Warning",n=3:"Error",1:"Normal")
Quit $$$OK
}

}

Before compiling this class in a user namespace, InterSystems IRIS must load supporting classes into the namespace; these
classes are required to store the data samples for SNMP.

To load the classes, run ^%SYSMONMGR, as described in Using ^%SYSMONMGR to Manage Application Monitor,
and do the following:

- Select option 2, Manage Monitor Classes.

- Select option 3, Register Monitor System Classes.

When you compile the sample class, it creates the SNMP.Sample.Example class to store the sample data.

Important:

Do not delete generated sample classes explicitly; if you select both the Application Monitor and generated
sample classes for deletion, the sample class routines remain although the monitor class routines are deleted, which causes an error. To ensure that all sample class routines are properly removed, delete only the
Application Monitor class that generated it; when you delete the monitor class both the monitor class and
generated sample class, as well as related routines for both classes, are deleted. For example, to delete a sample class (for example, SNMP.Sample.Example), use the Management Portal to delete the monitor class from which it is generated (that is, SNMP.Example).

Run ^%SYSMONMGR to activate the sample class and start the Application Monitor to collect samples:

1. Select option 2, Manage Monitor Classes.

2. Select option 1, Activate/Deactivate a Monitor Class.

3. To see an numbered list of registered Monitor Classes, enter ?.

4. Enter the number of Monitor Class you want to activate; for example, to activate a user-defined class named

SNMP.Example, enter the number next to the class name.

5. Select option 6, Exit (to return to the Application Monitor main menu).

6. Select option 1, Manage Application Monitor.

7. Select option 1, Start Application Monitor.

8. Select option 5, Exit (to return to the Application Monitor main menu).

9. Select option 6, Exit (to exit from Application Monitor main menu).

Note:

For information about configuring and using Application Monitor, see Application Monitor.

Sample User-Defined SNMP Monitor Class

Example of Creating a User MIB

To create the SNMP MIB, run the MonitorTools.SNMP:CreateMIB method from the %SYS namespace. See the MonitorTools.SNMP class documentation for details.

The input parameters for the method are similar to the following:

CreateMIB("MyApp","USER",99990,1,"mycorp","myapp","mc","MC-MYAPP","Unknown",1)

Important:

Do not use 99990 as the Enterprise ID for production; each organization should register with the IANA
for their own ID.

USER>set $namespace = "%SYS"

%SYS>Do ##class(MonitorTools.SNMP).CreateMIB("MyApp","USER",99990,1,"mycorp",
"myapp","mc","MC-MYAPP","Unknown",1)

Create SNMP structure for Application - MyApp

Group - MyTable Counter1 = Integer Counter2 = Integer Status = String

Create MIB file for MyApp

Generate table MyTable Add object Counter1 Add object Counter2 Add object Status

%SYS>

This creates the MC-MYAPP.MIB file in your def ault directory (install-dir\mgr\User), which you can load into your SNMP management application.

Note:

You may need to restart the SNMP master agent and the InterSystems IRIS ^SNMP service on your system before each recognizes this MIB.

Monitoring InterSystems IRIS Using Web
Services

This topic introduces and briefly describes ho w to use InterSystems IRIS® data platform support for the WS-Management specification, which enables you to remotely monitor an InterSystems IRIS instance via SO AP.

B.1 Overview of InterSystems IRIS Support for
WS-Monitoring

Following the WS-Management specification , the SYS.WSMon package provides a web service that you can use to remotely monitor an InterSystems IRIS instance. It is functionally similar to the SNMP interface (see Monitoring InterSystems IRIS Using SNMP), but uses the built-in InterSystems IRIS web service services support.

The support for WS-Management includes the following elements:

- The Log Monitoring Web Service (SYS.WSMon.Service) that provides methods that return information about an InterSystems IRIS instance.

- An InterSystems IRIS web service client (SYS.WSMon.Client) that can invoke methods in this Monitoring Web Service or in the Monitoring Web Service of another InterSystems IRIS instance.

- Instead of using this web client, you can create your own web client, possibly using third-party technology.

- Several XML-enabled classes that this web service and client use to represent monitoring information.

These classes include SYS.WSMon.wsEvent, which can represent events.

A sample event sink web service (SYS.WSMon.EventSink) that can receive and process events. Via a SOAP call, you can subscribe to this sample event sink service so that it will receive events from any Monitoring Web Service.

Instead of using this sample, you can create your own, possibly using third-party technology.

These classes are available only in the %SYS namespace.

For basic monitoring, you can use the Log Monitoring Web Service with a web client in another instance. The image below shows a monitoring client requesting monitoring data from a target instance. The Log Monitoring Web Service on the target instance responds, sending the client monitoring data.

In more advanced cases, the web client subscribes an event sink service, possibly running on another InterSystems IRIS instance. For example, in the image below the monitoring client sends a request to the primary instance to subscribe a third instance. The primary instance’s Monitoring Web Service responds by sending subscription ID to the client, and thereafter sends events to the third instance. The third instance can process these events in a number of ways, such as to create custom reporting or alerting.

Your event sink web service can perform any processing needed by the business.

For information on generating web services and web clients from a WSDL, see Creating Web Services and Web Clients.

B.2 Support Details

InterSystems supports the following parts of the WS-Management specification:

- wxf:Get

- wsen:Enumerate

- wsen:Pull

- wsen:Release Caché instance3Caché instance1Caché instance2MonitoringClientRequesttosubscribeCachéinstanc...subscriptionIDeventsMonitoringWebService...EventSinkWebService...Customreporting...

URL for the Monitoring Web Service

- wse:Subscribe

- wse:Renew

- wse:Unsubscribe For more information, see the WS-Management specification (https://www.dmtf.org/standards/published_documents/DSP0226_1.1.pdf).

B.3 URL for the Monitoring Web Service

For a given InterSystems IRIS instance, the Log Monitoring Web Service is available at the following URL, using the
<baseURL> for your instance:

http://<baseURL>/csp/sys/SYS.WSMon.Service.cls

For example:

http://localhost:8000/csp/sys/SYS.WSMon.Service.cls

Similarly, the WSDL for this web service is available at the following URL, again using the <baseURL> for your instance:

http://<baseURL>/csp/sys/SYS.WSMon.Service.cls?WSDL=1

B.4 Web Methods of the Monitoring Web Service

The SYS.WSMon.Service class provides the following web methods:

EnumBuffer()

method EnumBuffer() as %XML.DataSet

Returns an instance of %XML.DataSet that enumerates the statistics for all buffer sizes. For this instance, the dataset uses the Sample() class query of the SYS.Stats.Buffer class.

For information on working with %XML.DataSet, see Using Datasets in SOAP Messages or see the class reference
for %XML.DataSet.

Also see the class reference for SYS.Stats.Buffer.

EnumDatabase()

method EnumDatabase() as %XML.DataSet

Returns an instance of %XML.DataSet that enumerates all databases for this instance. For this instance, the dataset uses the List() class query of the SYS.WSMon.wsDatabase class.

See the comments for EnumBuffer() and see the class reference for SYS.WSMon.wsDatabase.

EnumResource()

method EnumResource() as %XML.DataSet

Returns an instance of %XML.DataSet that enumerates statistics for all system resource seizes. For this instance, the dataset uses the Sample() class query of the SYS.Stats.Resource class.

See the comments for EnumBuffer() and see the class reference for SYS.Stats.Resource.

EnumWriteDaemon()

method EnumWriteDaemon() as %XML.DataSet

Returns an instance of %XML.DataSet that enumerates statistics for all write daemons. For this instance, the dataset uses the Sample() class query of the SYS.Stats.WriteDaemon class.

See the comments for EnumBuffer() and see the class reference for SYS.Stats.WriteDaemon.

EventCancel()

method EventCancel(id) as %Integer

Cancels the subscription for a given web service; see EventSubscribe().

EventSubscribe()

method EventSubscribe(location) as %String

Subscribes the given web service to receive information about events in this InterSystems IRIS instance. This can be your own web service or can be the SYS.WSMon.EventSink web service, which is provided as an example. If you create your own web service, it must follow the WSDL of the SYS.WSMon.EventSink web service.

For location, specify the URL needed to invoke the EventSink() method of the web service, using the <baseURL>
for your instance. For SYS.WSMon.EventSink, you might specify location as the following:

http://<baseURL>/csp/sys/SYS.WSMon.EventSink.cls

Where server is the server on which InterSystems IRIS is running, and port is the port that InterSystems IRIS uses.

For each event, InterSystems IRIS will attempt to call EventSink() method of the given web service, sending an instance of SYS.WSMon.wsEvent.

This method returns an ID that you can use to cancel the subscription; see EventCancel().

GetDisk()

method GetDisk() as SYS.Stats.Disk

Returns an instance of SYS.Stats.Disk that contains metrics of disk usage for globals for this instance.

See the class reference for SYS.Stats.Disk.

GetECPAppSvr()

method GetECPAppSvr() as SYS.Stats.ECPAppSvr

Returns an instance of SYS.Stats.ECPAppSvr that contains ECP application server metrics for this instance.

See the class reference for SYS.Stats.ECPAppSvr.

GetECPDataSvr()

method GetECPDataSvr() as SYS.Stats.ECPDataSvr

Returns an instance of SYS.Stats.ECPDataSvr that contains ECP database server metrics for this instance.

Monitoring Web Client

See the class reference for SYS.Stats.ECPDataSvr.

GetGlobal()

method GetGlobal() as SYS.Stats.Global

Returns an instance of SYS.Stats.Global that contains global metrics for this instance.

See the class reference for SYS.Stats.Global.

GetRoutine()

method GetRoutine() as SYS.Stats.Routine

Returns an instance of SYS.Stats.Routine that contains routine metrics for this instance.

See the class reference for SYS.Stats.Routine.

GetSystem()

method GetSystem() as SYS.WSMon.wsSystem

Returns an instance of SYS.WSMon.wsSystem that contains system information about the InterSystems IRIS instance.

See the class reference for SYS.WSMon.wsSystem.

B.5 Monitoring Web Client

The SYS.WSMon.Client class and related classes are an InterSystems IRIS web service client that can invoke methods of SYS.WSMon.Server web service in the same InterSystems IRIS instance or another InterSystems IRIS instance.

This web client class uses the following LOCATION parameter, using the <baseURL> for your instance:

Parameter LOCATION = "http://<baseURL>/csp/sys/SYS.WSMon.Service.cls"

Where server is the server on which InterSystems IRIS is running and port is the port that the InterSystems IRIS web service server uses.

Use this web client in the same way that you use other InterSystems IRIS web service clients:

1. Create an instance of the web client class.

2. Set its Location property if needed.

This is necessary if the SYS.WSMon.Server web service that you want to use is on a different machine than the client, or if it uses a port other than 52773.

3. Set other properties if needed.

See Creating Web Services and Web Clients.

4.

Invoke a web method.

5. Examine the value returned by the web method.

The details depend on the web method you invoke; see Web Methods of the Monitoring Web Service and see the class
reference for the return types.

The following shows an example Terminal session:

USER>set $namespace = "%SYS"

%SYS>set client=##class(SYS.WSMon.Client).%New()

%SYS>set client.Location="http://localhost:8000/csp/sys/SYS.WSMon.Service.cls"

%SYS>set myroutinestats=client.GetRoutine()

%SYS>write myroutinestats.RtnCallsLocal 19411581 %SYS>write myroutinestats.RtnCallsRemote 0 %SYS>write myroutinestats.RtnCommands 432764817
%SYS>

More typically, you create and use the client programmatically, perhaps to retrieve data for display in a user interface.

Note:

Remember that the SYS.WSMon package is available only in %SYS namespace, which means that you must be in that namespace to perform the steps described here.

B.6 Processing Events

InterSystems IRIS provides a sample web service (SYS.WSMon.EventSink) that can receive and process events sent by any Log Monitoring Web Service. You can use this web service or create and use your own.

B.6.1 Using the Sample Event Sink Web Service

SYS.WSMon.EventSink is a sample InterSystems IRIS web service service that can receive and process events.

For a given InterSystems IRIS instance, the Log Monitoring Web Service is available at the following URL, using the
<baseURL> for your instance:

http://<baseURL>/csp/sys/SYS.WSMon.EventSink.cls

Where server is the server on which InterSystems IRIS is running and port is the port that the InterSystems IRIS web service server uses.

This web service has one method:

CacheEventSink()

Method CacheEventSink(event As SYS.WSMon.wsEvent) As %Integer

On Windows platforms, this sample method displays a popup window when an event occurs; for other platforms,
it adds an entry to ^SYS("MONITOR","WSMON","EVENT_RECEIVED",$h).

This method always returns 1.

To subscribe this sample service so that it will receive events from the Monitoring Web Service, do the following in the
Terminal:

Processing Events

USER>set $namespace = "%sys"

%SYS>set client=##class(SYS.WSMon.Client).%New()

%SYS>set eventsinklocation="http://localhost:8000/csp/sys/SYS.WSMon.EventSink.cls"

%SYS>set subscriptionid=client.EventSubscribe(eventsinklocation)

%SYS>write subscriptionid CacheEventSubscription_2

Here eventsinklocation is the URL for the event sink web service that will process events.

B.6.2 Creating Your Own Event Sink Web Service

To create your own event sink web service, generate a web service from the following WSDL, using the <baseURL> for
your instance:

http://<baseURL>/csp/sys/SYS.WSMon.EventSink.cls?WSDL=1

Where server is the server on which InterSystems IRIS is running and port is the port that the InterSystems IRIS web service server uses.

For details, see Creating Web Services and Web Clients.

Then modify the CacheEventSink() method in the generated web service to include your custom logic.

Every InterSystems IRIS® data platform instance contains a REST interface that provides statistics about the instance. This REST API provides a way to gather information from multiple machines running InterSystems IRIS, allowing you to monitor in detail all instances that comprise your application. The API follows the OpenMetrics standard.

This topic describes the metrics provided by the /api/monitor service. These metrics are compatible with Prometheus, an open-source monitoring and alerting tool. Configuring Prometheus to scrape multiple connected InterSystems IRIS instances provides a cohesive view of your entire system, making it easier to evaluate whether the system is behaving properly and efficiently . If you are using a monitoring tool which is compatible with OpenTelemetry, you can also configure InterSystems IRIS to transmit the metrics provided by this service as OTLP/HTTP signals.

C.1 Introduction to /api/monitor Service

The /api/monitor service provides information about the InterSystems IRIS Instance on which it runs. By default, the /api/monitor web application is enabled with “Unauthenticated” access. For information about setting up authentication for this service, see Securing REST Services.

This API has the following endpoints:

- /api/monitor/metrics, which returns all instance metrics, and can be configured to return specific application metrics.

- /api/monitor/alerts, which returns any system alerts that have been posted since the endpoint was last scraped.

- /api/monitor/interop, which returns various interoperability usage metrics including the number of interfaces being run, the number of interoperability messages sent, and the overall impact on database size due to interoperabililty messages sent during a specified period.

Note:

InterSystems IRIS logs any errors in the SystemMonitor.log file, which is located in the

install-dir/mgr directory.

C.2 /api/monitor/metrics

The /api/monitor/metrics endpoint returns a list of metrics, which are described in Metric Descriptions. You can also enable the collection of additional metrics about active interoperability productions, as described in Interoperability Metrics. Create Application Metrics contains instructions for how to define custom metrics.

To configure Prometheus to scrape an instance of InterSystems IRIS, follo w the instructions in First Steps With Prometheus (https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/first_steps/ ).

C.2.1 Metric Descriptions

The metrics are returned in a text-based format, described in the Prometheus documentation (https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats/). Each metric is listed on a single line with only one space, which separates the name from the value. Each unique metric is preceded by # HELP and # TYPE comment lines (described in https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats/#comments-help-text-and-type-information). Where
applicable, InterSystems IRIS also includes a # UNIT comment line; this comment specifies the unit of measurement used
for the metric. You can configure custom application metrics to supply these comment lines as well.

The following tables list InterSystems IRIS metrics. Except for the first table, each table identifies the members of a Sensor Group, with the title of each table corresponding to that Sensor Group’s name. You can exclude Sensor Groups which
contain metrics that you do not need to collect; refer to the class reference for the ExcludeMetrics property for further
guidance

Note:

These tables contain metrics for the version of InterSystems IRIS documented here. As metrics may be added in newer versions, be sure this documentation matches your version of InterSystems IRIS.

C.2.2 Interoperability Metrics

Note:

The interoperability production data collected by the /metrics endpoint described in this section is very granular, providing detailed information about number of messages processed, average number of characters processed, etc. Users who wish to do a broader check-in about the statuses of their production interfaces can take advantage of REST APIs for Interoperability Usage Metrics.

In addition to the metrics described in the previous section, an InterSystems IRIS instance can also record metrics about active interoperability productions and include them in the output of the /metrics endpoint. The recording of these interoperability metrics is disabled by default. To enable it, you must perform the following steps for each interoperability production
you want to monitor:

1. Open a Terminal session for the InterSystems IRIS instance running the production you want to monitor. If necessary,

switch to the namespace associated with the production by executing the following command:

set $namespace = "[interopNS]"

where [interopNS] is the namespace name.

2.

In the Terminal, execute the following command to enable the collection of metrics for the active production within
the current namespace:

do ##class(Ens.Util.Statistics).EnableSAMForNamespace()

Note:

If the recording of metrics is enabled for a namespace but the corresponding production is not active, the /metrics endpoint does not return any metrics.

The Ens.Util.Statistics class provides methods for customizing the output of the /metrics endpoint. For example, invoking the method DisableSAMIncludeHostLabel will provide aggregated metrics for the entire production instead of providing them for each host individually.

The metrics available after completing this step are described in the Basic Interoperability Metrics and Message Retention Metrics tables below.

3. To collect additional metrics for a production, enable activity monitoring by invoking the class method

Ens.Util.Statistics.EnableStatsForProduction in the corresponding namespace using the Terminal. You must also add the Ens.Activity.Operation.Local business operation to the production. This process is detailed in Enabling
Activity Monitoring.

The additional metrics available after completing this step are described in the Activity Volume Metrics table below.

4. To collect additional HTTP transmission metrics for EnsLib.HTTP.OutboundAdapter or the EnsLib.SOAP.Outbound-
Adapter (used in productions), enable the reporting of HTTP metrics for the corresponding business operation by per-
forming the following steps:

a. Open the Management Portal for the InterSystems IRIS instance containing the web client you want to monitor.

b. Select Interoperability and choose the namespace containing the web client.

c. Select Configure > Production to open the Production Configuration page.

d. Select the operation which uses the HTTP or SOAP outbound adapter.

e.

f.

In the Alerting Control section of the operation’s Settings panel, select the Provide Metrics for SAM check box.

Select Apply to save your settings.

The additional metrics available after completing this step are described in the HTTP Metrics table below.

Note:

Currently, HTTP transmission metrics are only collected for business operations which invoke actors using the Queue style (not inProc). For more information on the difference between these invocation styles, see Defining a Business Operation Class.

InterSystems IRIS interoperability metrics are listed in the tables below. Metric names with a label appear here with line breaks to improve readability.

Note:

These tables contain metrics for the version of InterSystems IRIS documented here. As metrics may be added in newer versions, be sure this documentation matches your version of InterSystems IRIS.

The Message Retention Metrics, described in the following table, can help you to determine if your production data is being purged appropriately. These metrics are tabulated by the Collect() method of the Ens.SAM.GeneralMetrics class, which can be called directly or scheduled for execution by the “Collect Interoperability Message Retention Metrics” task,
Ens.Util.Tasks.MonitorMetrics.

You can use the DayBoundariesForCounts property to specify different day boundaries for message header count calculation cutoffs. The value of this property is a comma-separated list of the number of days to show message header counts, excluding oldest and 0. The default value is "56, 28, 14, 7, 1".

To call the API directly:

do ##class(Ens.SAM.GeneralMetrics).Collect(<boundaries>)

The boundaries parameter is optional, and provides the value for DayBoundariesForCounts.

C.2.2.1 REST APIs for Interoperability Usage Metrics

This section describes the /interop/current and /interop/historical endpoints and the parameters that can be used to filter their results.

/api/monitor/metrics

Note:

The weekly scheduled task Purge Interoperability Usage Metrics consolidates daily metrics data into monthly
aggregates. When you call a /current endpoint, the response data contains daily data; when you call a
/historical endpoint, the response data contains monthly aggregate data.

Each of the interoperability usage metrics endpoints described in this section allows you to specify a date range
to filter the results. If no dates are specified:

- /current endpoints results include all relevant data that has not yet been purged from the interoperability metrics.

- /historical endpoints results include all relevant data that has been consolidated into monthly aggregates.

Important:

All dates and times in these APIs are UTC.

The following REST APIs are available for interoperability usage metrics:

/interop/[current|historical]/interfaces

Calls to the /interop/[current|historical]/interfaces endpoint return the number of unique interfaces that have run within a specified time span.

The metrics returned by the /interop/[current|historical]/interfaces endpoint are enumerated by
interface type. Interface types are as follows:

- Inbound Interfaces — Inbound business services.

- Outbound Interfaces — Outbound business operations.

- Web APIs — Manually created CSP applications. These are defined on the Web Applications page of the management portal, not within a production. Web API interfaces can feed in to REST and SOAP services or can be used for calls to custom code outside of a production.

For a discussion of inbound and outbound production interfaces, see Formal Overview of Productions.

Table III–22: Parameters for /interfaces

end

endmonth

namespace

start

For use with /current/interfaces. A date or datetime in UTC, indicating the end of the date range for which results will be returned, specified in ODBC format: YYYY-MM-DD[HH:MM:SS]. If time is not specified, HH:MM:SS is assumed to be 23:59:59.

For use with /historical/interfaces. The final month in the date range for which results will be returned. Format is YYYY-MM.

The namespace for which results will be returned. If not specified, results include all namespaces.

For use with /current/interfaces. A date or datetime in UTC, indicating the beginning of the date range for which results will be returned, specified in ODBC format: YYYY-MM-DD[HH:MM:SS]. If time is not specified, HH:MM:SS is assumed to be 00:00:00.

startmonth

For use with /historical/interfaces. The first month in the date range for which results will be returned. Format is YYYY-MM.

Note:

/interfaces also responds to requests at the following deprecated endpoints, which aggregate results over specified interv als of time: /interfaces/year, /interfaces/month, /interfaces/day. However, InterSystems discourages customers from using these endpoints.

/interop/[current|historical]/databaseimpact

Calls to the /interop/[current|historical]/databaseimpact endpoint return the change in size (in MB) of the database where interoperability metrics data are stored, over a specified period. This approximates the total size of messages received during that timespan.

Database impact metrics are collected each time production data is purged.

Table III–23: Parameters for /databaseimpact

database

end

endmonth

start

For use with /current/databaseimpact. A date or datetime in UTC, indicating the end of the date range for which results will be returned, specified in ODBC format: YYYY-MM-DD[HH:MM:SS]. If time is not specified, HH:MM:SS is assumed to be 23:59:59.

For use with /historical/databaseimpact. The final month in the date range for which results will be returned.

For use with /current/databaseimpact. A date or datetime in UTC, specified in ODBC format (YYYY-MM-DD[HH:MM:SS], indicating the beginning of the date range for which results will be returned. If time is not specified, HH:MM:SS is assumed to be 00:00:00.

startmonth

For use with /historical/databaseimpact. The first month in the date range for which results will be returned.

/interop/[current|historical]/volume

Calls to the /interop/[current|historical]/volume endpoint return the number of inbound and outbound interoperability messages sent and received over a specified period, enumerated by namespace.

For use with /current/volume. A date in UTC, indicating the end of the date range for which results will be returned, specified in ODBC format: YYYY-MM-DD.

For use with /historical/volume. The final month in the date range for which results will be returned.

The namespace for which results will be returned. If not specified, results include all namespaces.

For use with /current/volume. A date in UTC, indicating the beginning of the date range for which results will be returned, specified in ODBC format: YYYY-MM-DD

startmonth

For use with /historical/volume. The first month in the date range for which results will be returned.

/interop/[current|historical]/range

The weekly scheduled task Purge Interoperability Usage Metrics consolidates daily metrics data into monthly aggregates, purging daily data that is at least one month old.

/api/monitor/metrics

Calls to the /interop/[current|historical]/range endpoint return the date of both the earliest and most recent daily interoperability usage metrics data. If no metrics data exist, the response is empty. This is a utility API designed to help you determine what dates to enter as parameters in calls to the other endpoints.

This endpoint takes no parameters.

If you want to ignore null messages, use the ObjectScript shell to specify overrides. You can ignore all null messages in
the namespace by entering the following command:

ObjectScript

set ^Ens.Config("Stats", "BusinessServices", "IgnoreNullMessages")=1

Or you can ignore null messages for a specific b usiness host by entering the following command, where config-name is
the configuration name of the b usiness host:

ObjectScript

set ^Ens.Config("Stats", "BusinessServices", "IgnoreNullMessages", "config-name")=1

For example:

ObjectScript

set ^Ens.Config("Stats", "BusinessServices", "IgnoreNullMessages", "BusinessHostA")=1 set ^Ens.Config("Stats", "BusinessServices", "IgnoreNullMessages", "BusinessHostB")=1 set ^Ens.Config("Stats", "BusinessServices", "IgnoreNullMessages", "BusinessHostC")=1

This step is a one-time setup step.

C.2.3 Create Application Metrics

To add custom application metrics to those returned by the /metrics endpoint:

1. Create a new class that inherits from %SYS.Monitor.SAM.Abstract.

2. Define the PRODUCT parameter as the name of your application. This can be anything except for iris, which is

reserved for the InterSystems IRIS metrics.

3.

Implement the GetSensors() method to define the desired custom metrics, as follo ws:

- The method must contain one or more calls to the SetSensor() method. This method sets the name and value for an application metric. The values should be integers or floating point numbers to ensure compatibility with
Prometheus.

- You can optionally define a label for the metric, though if you do, you must al ways define a label for that particular metric.

- Note:

For best practices when choosing metric and label names, see Metric and Label Naming in the Prometheus documentation (https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/naming/).

The method can optionally include labels for a metric by invoking the SetSensorLabels() method. However: if you define a label for a metric, you must include that label e very time you set that metric.

The method can optionally define HELP, TYPE, and UNIT information for a metric by invoking the SetSensorInfo() method. The output of the /metrics endpoint will include this information as comments. Refer to the Prometheus documentation for more information: https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats/#commentshelp-text-and-type-information

- The method must return $$$OK if successful.

Important:

A slow implementation of GetSensors() can negatively impact system performance. Be sure to test that your implementation of GetSensors() is efficient, and a void implementations that could time out or hang.

4. Compile the class. An example is shown below:

Class Definition

/// Example of a custom class for the /metric API
Class MyMetrics.Example Extends %SYS.Monitor.SAM.Abstract
{

Parameter PRODUCT = "myapp";

/// Collect metrics from the specified sensors
Method GetSensors() As %Status
{
do ..SetSensor("my_counter",$increment(^MyCounter),"my_label")
do ..SetSensor("my_gauge",$random(100))
return $$$OK
}

}

5. Use the AddApplicationClass() method of the SYS.Monitor.SAM.Config class to add the custom class to the /metrics

configuration. P ass as arguments the name of the class and the namespace where it is located.

For example, enter the following in the Terminal from the %SYS namespace:

%SYS>set status = ##class(SYS.Monitor.SAM.Config).AddApplicationClass("MyMetrics.Example", "USER")

%SYS>w status status=1

Note: When you upgrade your InterSystems IRIS system, you will need to redo this step.

6. Ensure that /api/monitor web application has the necessary Application Roles to access the custom metrics. For details

on how to edit application roles, see Edit an Application: The Application Roles Tab.

This step grants /api/monitor access to the data needed for the custom metric. For example, if the custom metric class is located in the USER database (protected by the %DB_USER resource), grant /api/monitor the %DB_USER role.

7. Review the output of the /metrics endpoint by pointing your browser to a URL with the following form, using the

<baseURL> for your system: http://<baseURL>/api/monitor/metrics. The metrics you defined should appear after the
InterSystems IRIS metrics, such as:

[...]
myapp_my_counter{id="my_label") 1
myapp_my_gauge 92

The /metrics endpoint now returns the custom metrics you defined. The InterSystems IRIS metrics include an iris_ prefix, while your custom metrics use the value of PRODUCT as a prefix.

C.3 /api/monitor/alerts

The /api/monitor/alerts endpoint fetches the most recent alerts from the alerts.log file and returns them in JSON format, such
as:

{"time":"2019-08-15T10:36:38.313Z","severity":2,\
"message":"Failed to allocate 1150MB shared memory using large pages. Switching to small pages."}

When /api/monitor/alerts is called, it returns the alerts that have been generated since the previous time /api/monitor/alerts was called. The iris_system_alerts_new metric is a Boolean that indicates whether new alerts have been generated.

For more information about when and how alerts are generated, see Using Log Monitor.

- https://prometheus.io/docs/ Monitoring InterSystems IRIS Using the irisstat Utility This topic provides an overview of how to use the irisstat utility. It is intended as an introduction for new users and a reference for experienced users.

Important: When using this utility, you should consult with the InterSystems Worldwide Response Center (WRC) for guidance about specifying appropriate irisstat options and assistance in interpreting the data produced by the utility.

irisstat is a C executable that is distributed with InterSystems IRIS® data platform. It is a diagnostic tool for system level problems, including InterSystems IRIS hangs, network problems, and performance issues. When run, irisstat attaches to the shared memory segment allocated by InterSystems IRIS at start time, and displays an InterSystems IRIS instance’s internal structures and tables in a readable format. The shared memory segment contains the global buffers, lock table, journal buffers, and a wide variety of other memory structures which need to be accessible to all InterSystems IRIS processes. Processes also maintain their own process private memory for their own variables and stack information. The basic displayonly options of irisstat are fast and non-invasive to InterSystems IRIS.

CAUTION: More advanced (undocumented) options may alter shared memory and should be used with care. These

advanced options should be used only at the direction of InterSystems Support personnel; for information,
contact the InterSystems Worldwide Response Center (WRC).

D.1 Basics of Running irisstat

In the event of a system problem, the irisstat report is often the most important tool that InterSystems has to determine the
cause of the problem. Use the following guidelines to ensure that the irisstat report contains all of the necessary information:

- Run irisstat at the time of the event.

- Use the Diagnostic Report task or IRISHung script unless directed otherwise by InterSystems support personnel.

- Check the contents of the irisstat report to ensure it is valid.

Since irisstat is a separate executable file included with InterSystems IRIS, it is run outside of InterSystems IRIS, at an
operating system prompt. Therefore, the details of running it depend on the operating system:

- Running irisstat on Windows

- Running irisstat on UNIX® Running irisstat with no options is not a common way to run it, but doing so produces a basic report which is the equivalent
of running it with the following default options:

- -f (global module flags)

- -p (PID table)

- -q (semaphores) For information about irisstat options, see Running irisstat with Options.

D.1.1 Running irisstat on Windows

The irisstat executable is located in the install-dir\bin directory. Starting with a Windows command prompt running as
Administrator, you can run it as follows:

C:\>cd install-dir\bin

C:\install-dir\bin>irisstat

If you run irisstat from a directory other than install-dir\bin or install-dir\mgr, you must include the -s argument to specify
the location of the install-dir\mgr directory. For example:

C:\Users>\install-dir\bin\irisstat -s\install-dir\mgr

D.1.2 Running irisstat on UNIX®

The irisstat executable is located in the install-dir/bin directory. If you run irisstat from a directory other than install-dir\bin or install-dir\mgr, you must include the -s argument to specify the location of the install-dir\mgr directory.

Starting with a UNIX® command prompt running as root, change to the install-dir/bin directory or the install-dir/mgr
directory and run the irisstat command:

bash-3.00$ ./irisstat

From the InterSystems IRIS installation directory, the command would be as follows:

bash-3.00$ ./bin/irisstat -smgr

You can also invoke irisstat via the iris command, which can be run from any directory as shown in the following example:

bash-3.00$ iris stat iris_instance_name

where iris_instance_name is the name of the InterSystems IRIS instance on which you are running irisstat.

D.2 Running irisstat with Options

Running irisstat without options produces a basic report. Generally, you run irisstat to obtain specific information. To
specify target information, you can include or exclude options as follows:

- To include (turn on) an option, specify a flag follo wed by a 1 (or other level).

- To exclude (turn off) an option, specify a flag follo wed by a 0.

For example, to include the Global File Table (GFILETAB) section in the irisstat report, use the -m1 option:

Running irisstat with Options

C:\iris-install-dir\Bin\irisstat -m1

or, to turn off the default basic options, use the -a0 option:

C:\iris-install-dir\bin\irisstat -a0

Many options have more detailed levels than 0 and 1. These additional levels are described as having bits, which are displayed in decimal as powers of two and control specific types of information about the option. F or example, the basic -p option,
which displays the PID table, is turned on with a 1; however, using a 2 adds a swcheck column, a 4 adds a pstate column.
and so on. These bits can be combined; for example, if you want to see the information displayed by both the 2 and 4 bits,
specify -p6. To ask for all bits, use -1, as follows:

bash-3.00$ ./irisstat -p-1

In addition, multiple flags can be combined in a single the basic options, then turns on all bits for the global module flags and PID table, as well as a detailed le vel for the
GFILETAB:

irisstat command. For example, the following command turns off

bash-3.00$ ./irisstat -a0 -f-1 -p-1 -m3

It is common for irisstat commands to have many flags when you start diagnosing a comple x problem; however, the options
that make modifications are typically used alone. F or example, the -d option requests a process dump; before using this
option, you might run irisstat with multiple options to identify the process to dump, but when using -d, typically no other options are selected.

The irisstat Options table describes the options that you can use with the irisstat command.

Note:

For assistance in interpreting the data produced by the irisstat options described in this table, contact the InterSystems Worldwide Response Center (WRC).

Use of this option is recorded in the messages log.

Displays the contents of the device translation table. It is organized by device number and shows both the numeric and plaintext class identifiers.

D.3 Viewing irisstat Output

irisstat data can be viewed immediately (via a terminal) or redirected to an output file for later analysis. The most common
methods for viewing the data are:

- irisstat Text File

- Diagnostic Report Task

- IRISHung Script

- ^SystemPerformance Utility Note: When InterSystems IRIS is forcibly shut down, irisstat is run in order to capture the current state of the system.

The output is added to the messages log as part of the emergency shutdown procedure.

D.3.1 irisstat Text File

irisstat reports can be redirected to a file instead of the terminal, which might be useful if you w ant to collect a set of irisstat options that are not provided by one of the InterSystems IRIS tools (Diagnostic Report Task, IRISHung Script, ^SystemPerformance Utility) or if you are having trouble running those tools.

D.3.2 Diagnostic Report Task

The Diagnostic Report task creates an HTML log file containing both basic and adv anced information, which can be used by the InterSystems Worldwide Response Center (WRC) to resolve system problems. For information about the Diagnostic Report task, including the irisstat options that it uses, see Using the InterSystems Diagnostic Report.

Note:

The Diagnostic Report task cannot be run on a hung system; if your system is hung, see IRISHung Script.

D.3.3 IRISHung Script

The IRISHung script is an OS tool used to collect data on the system when an InterSystems IRIS instance is hung. The
name of the script, which is located in the install-dir\bin directory, is platform-specific, as specified in the follo wing table:

Viewing irisstat Output

Platform

Microsoft Windows

UNIX®/Linux

Script name

IRISHung.cmd

IRISHung.sh

The IRISHung script should be run with Administrator privileges. Like the Diagnostic Report Task, the IRISHung script runs irisstat twice, 30 seconds apart, in case the status is changing, and bundles the reports into an html file together with
the other collected data. The irisstat reports taken from IRISHung use the following options:

irisstat -e2 -f-1 -m-1 -n3 -j5 -g1 -L1 -u-1 -v1 -p-1 -c-1 -q1 -w2 -N65535

IRISHung also runs a third irisstat using only the -S2 option, which it writes to a separate section of output called Self-
Diagnosis. The -S2 option causes suspect processes to leave mini-dumps; therefore, running IRISHung is likely to collect
information about the specific processes responsible for the hang, whereas simply forcing the instance do wn does not collect this information.

In addition, IRISHung generates irisstat output files that are often v ery large, in which case they are saved to separate .txt files. Remember to check for these files when collecting the output.

D.3.4 ^SystemPerformance Utility

The ^SystemPerformance utility collects detailed performance data about an InterSystems IRIS instance and the platform on which it is running. It runs inside InterSystems IRIS for a configurable amount of time, collects samples o ver the that interval, and generates a report when it finishes. F or information about the ^SystemPerformance utility, including the irisstat options that it uses, see Monitoring Performance Using ^SystemPerformance.
