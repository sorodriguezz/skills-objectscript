# Introduction to InterSystems IRIS Business Intelligence

Introduction to Business Intelligence

This page introduces InterSystems IRIS Business Intelligence, which enables you to embed business intelligence (BI) into your applications.

Note:

You can use Business Intelligence only in a specifically configured web application. See Application. Also, be sure to consult InterSystems Supported Platforms for information on system requirements.

Setting Up the Web

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of InterSystems Business Intelligence is to enable you to embed business intelligence (BI) into your applications so that your users can ask and answer sophisticated questions of their data. Specifically , your application can include
dashboards, which can include the following:

- Interactive widgets that execute queries designed for specific user roles or for specific areas of your user interf

- ace.

- Controls such as drop-down lists and data choosers that enable users to modify these queries.

- Interactive drill options that enable users to view the displayed data in different ways.

- Options to export, print, and send alerts to other users.

- An option to launch the Mini Analyzer, which supports free-form analysis.

Execute custom actions that are provided as buttons or other controls.

In contrast to traditional BI systems that use static data warehouses, Business Intelligence is kept closely in synchronization with the live transactional data, as required for your business.

### 1.2 Dashboard Visual Details

The following example shows a sample dashboard:

A dashboard consists of the following areas:

- The upper left displays the name of the dashboard and (if defined) its title.

- Depending on the system configuration and on the indi vidual layout of a dashboard, a dashboard can include zero, one, or two worklist areas on the left. For any worklist area, the upper right corner displays icons to indicate which
worklists it can display. For example:

The highlighted icon indicates which worklist is currently displayed. You can select a different icon to display the corresponding worklist in this area instead.

The Filters worklist is specific to the dashboard. You use this to filter the widgets sho wn on this dashboard.

- The right area contains one or more widgets. Each widget is a rectangular panel that displays data in some form.

The following subsection describes the more common widgets.

#### 1.2.1 Pivot Table Widgets

A pivot table widget displays data in one of three formats. First, it can display the data as a table:

Second, it can display the data as a chart:

Third, it can display a detail listing, which is a table that shows selected fields from the lo west-level records:

#### 1.2.2 Scorecard Widgets

A scorecard widget displays one or more rows of data in a tabular format that also includes features such as value-dependent
lamps and arrows. For example:

#### 1.2.3 Meter Widgets

A meter widget displays one or more values, each in a graphical object as follows:

The preceding picture shows values in a speedometer. Business Intelligence supports several other forms of meters.

#### 1.2.4 Map Widgets

A map widget shows a map with highlighted points that typically correspond to locations that are relevant to your business
scenario:

#### 1.2.5 Calendar Widgets

A dashboard can include an informational calendar widget like the following:

#### 1.2.6 Custom Widgets

A dashboard can also include custom widgets called portlets. The following shows an example:

### 1.3 Data Sources for Widgets

In a dashboard, most widgets use a data source, which is one of the following:

- A pivot table. Pivot tables are created in the Analyzer. A pivot table is a query based on a cube, which is part of a Business Intelligence model. The following section discusses Business Intelligence models.

- A KPI (key performance indicator). A KPI is a more advanced query created by a programmer; it is also part of a
Business Intelligence model.

### 1.4 Business Intelligence Models

A Business Intelligence model includes some or all of the following elements:

- At least one cube definition. A cube describes ways that you can query a set of specific base elements (such as patients or transactions). A cube includes levels, which enable you to group records from the base set, and measures, which show aggregate values of those records. It also defines listings and other items.

You use a cube to create pivot tables. For example:

Business Intelligence Models

In this pivot table, the rows correspond to the members of the Patient Group level; each member is shown as one
row. The data column displays the aggregate value of the Avg Test Score measure for each of these members; for
this measure, the system computes the average value. Notice that the Avg Test Score is null for the None patient group.

- Any number of subject areas. A subject area is a subcube that enables users to focus on smaller sets of data without the need for multiple cubes. A subject area also enables you to customize captions and defaults of the cube.

- Any number of KPIs (key performance indicators). In Business Intelligence, a KPI is an interactive dataset that can be displayed on a dashboard. It uses a custom query created by a programmer. The query can use SQL, MDX (Multi- Dimensional Expressions, which is also generated by the Analyzer), or custom code.

The KPI can also define actions, which a user can launch and which execute your custom code.

Introduction to the Business Intelligence
User Interfaces

This page provides a quick look at the InterSystems IRIS Business Intelligence user interfaces.

Note:

You can use Business Intelligence only in a specifically configured web application. See Application. Also, be sure to consult InterSystems Supported Platforms for information on system requirements.

Setting Up the Web

For information on the PMML Model Tester, see Using PMML Models in InterSystems IRIS.

### 2.1 Logging On to Business Intelligence

To log on to Business Intelligence, do the following in the Management Portal:

1. Switch to the appropriate namespace as follows:

a. Select the current namespace name to open the list of available namespaces.

b. Select the appropriate namespace from the list.

2. Select Analytics. The system displays a list of the tools for Business Intelligence:

- Architect — Enables you to define cubes .

- Analyzer — Enables you to define pi vot tables.

- User Portal — Launches the User Portal, which includes the Analyzer and the Dashboard Designer.

- Tools — Provides access to the MDX Query Tool, the Term List Manager, Quality Measures, and the Model
Browser.

- Admin — Provides access to the Business Intelligence Logs, the Folder Manager, Settings, and the Cube Manager.

Note:

The Management Portal provides access to all Business Intelligence tools, including the back-end tools such as the Architect as well as the User Portal. Because the User Portal is intended for end users, it does not enable most users to return to the Management Portal.

### 2.2 Architect

The Architect enables you to define cubes and subject areas. You can use this tool or an IDE, or both together.

When you first display the Architect, using the sample HoleFoods cube, you see the following:

For details, see Defining Models for InterSystems Business Intellig ence.

For information on the permissions needed to use this tool, see Setting Up Security.

### 2.3 Analyzer

The Analyzer enables you to define pi vot tables. The Analyzer looks like the following.

For information, see Using the Analyzer.

For information on the permissions needed to use this tool, see Setting Up Security.

### 2.4 User Portal

The User Portal is intended for direct use by end users. The User Portal includes the Analyzer and the Dashboard Designer.

The User Portal looks like the following:

User Portal

For information, see Using Dashboards and the User Portal.

For information on the permissions needed to use this tool, see Setting Up Security.

### 2.5 MDX Query Tool

The Business Intelligence MDX Query Tool enables you to run ad hoc MDX queries. It looks like the following:

To execute an MDX query, type the query into the text box and then select Execute. You can also drag and drop items from
the left area into the MDX statement area; if you do, the dropped items are added to the end of the query.

The bottom area on the right then displays the results.

To see the plan for the query, select Show Plan. For example:

For an introduction to MDX, see Using InterSystems MDX. For reference information on MDX, see the InterSystems MDX
Reference.

For information on the permissions needed to use this tool, see Setting Up Security.

### 2.6 Term List Manager

The Term List Manager enables you to build term lists, which provide a way to modify a Business Intelligence model
without programming. It looks like the following:

Listing Group Manager

For information on creating term lists, see Advanced Modeling for InterSystems Business Intelligence.

For information on the permissions needed to use this tool, see Setting Up Security.

### 2.7 Listing Group Manager

The Listing Group Manager enables you to define listings that are not contained in an y cube definition. The purpose of this tool is to enable you (and your customers, if appropriate) to define listings outside of cube definitions and without needing
access to the Architect. The Listing Group Manager looks like this:

For information, see Defining Listing Groups .

For information on the permissions needed to use this tool, see Setting Up Security.

### 2.8 Quality Measure Manager

The Quality Measure Manager enables you to define quality measures, a kind of calculated measure that can be reused in
multiple contexts. It looks like the following:

Model Browser

For information, see Advanced Modeling for InterSystems Business Intelligence

For information on the permissions needed to use this tool, see Setting Up Security.

### 2.9 Model Browser

The Model Browser is a useful way of viewing relationships among cubes. It looks like the following:

For information, see Defining Models for InterSystems Business Intellig ence.

For information on the permissions needed to use this tool, see Setting Up Security.

### 2.10 Business Intelligence Logs

The Logs option displays the Business Intelligence log file, which the system generates when it b uilds cubes. It looks like
the following:

For information on the permissions needed to access this page, see Setting Up Security.

### 2.11 Folder Manager

The Folder Manager enables you to manage items within user folders. It looks like the following:

Folder Manager

You can use this to export pivot tables and dashboards so that you can package their definitions into a class definition. See Implementing InterSystems Business Intelligence.

For information on the permissions needed to use this tool, see Setting Up Security.

### 2.12 Settings

The Settings option lets you specify settings that affect the appearance of Business Intelligence within this namespace. It
looks like the following:

For information, see Implementing InterSystems Business Intelligence.

For information on the permissions needed to use this tool, see Setting Up Security.

### 2.13 Cube Manager

The Cube Manager enables you to easily update cubes. Using the Cube Manager, you can define a schedule for when you want to update your cubes. The Cube Manager then adds automated tasks that rebuild and (when supported) synchronize
your cubes at the dates and times which are specified by the schedule. It looks lik e the following:

For details, see Using the Cube Manager.

For information on the permissions needed to use this tool, see Setting Up Security.

Introduction to the Other Business
Intelligence Tools

This page introduces the other tools for working with InterSystems IRIS Business Intelligence.

### 3.1 BI Samples

Most of the samples in this documentation are part of the Samples-BI sample (https://github.com/intersystems/Samples- BI) or the Samples-Aviation sample (https://github.com/intersystems/Samples-Aviation).

InterSystems recommends that you create a dedicated namespace called SAMPLES (for example) and load samples into that namespace. For the general process, see Downloading Samples for Use with InterSystems IRIS.

### 3.2 MDX Shell

The system provides a shell in which you can issue MDX queries to explore your cubes and subject areas. This section introduces this shell and lists the supported MDX options and functions.

For an introduction to MDX queries, see Using InterSystems MDX, which contains many examples.

Also see the InterSystems MDX Reference.

#### 3.2.1 Accessing the MDX Shell

To access the MDX shell, start the Terminal and do the following:

1. Switch to the namespace in which you defined the cube or subject area.

2. Enter the following command:

ObjectScript

Do ##class(%DeepSee.Utils).%Shell()

Introduction to the Other Business Intelligence Tools

Now you can enter MDX queries like the following:

SELECT MEASURES.[%COUNT] ON 0, birthd.decade.MEMBERS ON 1 FROM patients

When you do so, the shell executes the query, displays its results to the console, and redisplays the shell prompt, as follows:

Patient Count
## 5 1950s 1,030 6 1960s 1,500
## 7 1970s 1,520 8 1980s 1,400
## 9 1990s 1,413 10 2000s 1,433
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- Elapsed time: .014128s

In the shell:

- To display a list of cubes and subject areas, enter cube

- To see the contents of a cube or subject area, enter cube name_of_cube_or_subject_area

- Note:

- This command does not display calculated members and named sets, although you can use these elements in the shell and elsewhere.

- For a subject area, this command lists all elements, even if those are specified as hidden in the subject area.

- To exit the shell, enter q

- To enable query caching, enter cache on. If you set cache off and then run an MDX query in the shell, the MDX shell purges all cached queries for that specific cube system-wide. This could lead to slower performance for other users.

- To enable the asynchronous mode, enter async on To build a cube, enter build cubename To reset the query cache, enter reset

For a list of additional shell options, enter ?

#### 3.2.2 Viewing the Indexes Used by a Query

The Business Intelligence shell provides a quick way to see the indexes that a query uses:

1.

Issue the following shell command:

stats on

2. Enter the query, preceded by %SHOWPLAN. For example:

%SHOWPLAN SELECT aged.[age group].members ON 0, allerd.H1.MEMBERS ON 1 FROM patients WHERE colord.red

## 0 to 29 30 to 59 60 +

Utility Methods

-------------- Query Plan --------------------- **%SHOWPLAN SELECT [AGED].[AGE GROUP].MEMBERS ON 0,[ALLERD].[H1].MEMBERS ON 1 FROM [PATIENTS] WHERE
[COLORD].[RED]**
**DIMENSION QUERY (%FindMemberByName): SELECT TOP 1 %ID,Dx327553094 MKEY,Dx327553094 FROM Cubes_StudyPatients.Star327553094 WHERE Dx327553094=? ORDER BY Dx327553094** **EXECUTE PARALLEL: 1x1 task(s) **
**CONSOLIDATE**
-------------- End of Plan -----------------

Line breaks were added here for readability.

The system captures all the indexes used by the query and reports them. Note that the query results are not necessarily
correct because the query is only partially run; the purpose of %SHOWPLAN is to enable you to see the indexes, not to get
the query results.

### 3.3 Utility Methods

- The class %SYSTEM.DeepSee includes the most commonly used utility methods. These include:

– BuildCube()

– KillCube()

– ListCubes()

– Reset()

–

–

Shell()

SynchronizeCube()

This class is available via the special variable $SYSTEM, as are all classes in the %SYSTEM package. For example,
to build a cube, you can use the following:

ObjectScript

Do $system.DeepSee.BuildCube("MyCube")

- The class %DeepSee.Utils includes a large set of utility methods, including:

– %ExportExcelToFile() — exports a Business Intelligence query or KPI to a file in Microsoft Excel format

– %ExportPDFToFile() — exports a Business Intelligence query or KPI to a file in PDF format

– %GetAgentCount() — gets the current agent count

– %GetBaseCube() — gets the name of cube on which a subject area is based

– %GetCubeFactClass() — gets the name of fact table class associated with a cube

– %GetCubeLevels() — gets the levels, measures, and relationships defined in a cube

– %GetDimensionMembers() — gets the list of members of a dimension

– %GetMetricList() — gets all production business metrics visible to current user

Introduction to the Other Business Intelligence Tools

– %GetSQLTableName() — gets SQL table name for a given class

– %ProcessFact() — updates a single fact for a cube

– %GetMDXFromPivot() — returns the MDX query defined by a pi vot table

– %ExecutePivot() — runs the MDX query defined by a pi vot table and optionally returns an instance of

%DeepSee.ResultSet

– %GetResultsetFromPivot() — returns an instance of %DeepSee.ResultSet that holds the MDX query defined

by a pivot table and optionally runs that query

- The class %DeepSee.UserLibrary.Utils includes methods that you can use to programmatically perform the tasks supported
in the Folder Manager. These methods include:

– %AddFavorite()

– %DeleteFolderContents()

– %DeleteFolderItem()

– %Export()

– %GetFolderList()

– %ImportContainer()

### 3.4 Data Connector

The data connector class (%DeepSee.DataConnector) enables you to make arbitrary SQL queries available for use in cubes and listings. See Implementing InterSystems Business Intelligence.

### 3.5 Result Set API

The class %DeepSee.ResultSet enables you to execute MDX queries programmatically and access the results.

For information, see Implementing InterSystems Business Intelligence.

### 3.6 JavaScript and REST APIs

The Business Intelligence JavaScript API is provided by the file DeepSee.js, which is in the install-dir/CSP/broker directory. This JavaScript library enables you to interact with Business Intelligence from a client that is based on JavaScript. The functions in this library are a wrapper for a REST-based API for Business Intelligence. You can also use the REST API directly.

For information, see Client-Side APIs for InterSystems Business Intelligence.

This glossary summarizes terms found in the InterSystems IRIS Business Intelligence documentation. If you have not yet done so, InterSystems highly recommends that you read Basic Concepts.

action

An operation that a user can start by using a control (such as a button) on a dashboard. The system provides a set of standard actions (such as applying a filter , navigating to another dashboard, and others), and you can add custom actions. See Defining Custom Actions.

age dimension and age level

An age dimension is a dimension that contains age levels. An age level groups data by an age, relative to the cube build time, computed from a date or time value in the source data. Age dimensions and age levels are not generally recommended, because they require nightly rebuilds.

age measure

A measure that provides an aggregated age value in days. Age measures are not generally recommended, because they require nightly rebuilds.

All level and All member

The All level is a special, optional level, which appears in all the hierarchies of a dimension. If defined, this le vel contains one member, the All member, which corresponds to all records in the cube. You can use the All member to create a summary line in a pivot table.

BI

Business intelligence, a set of tools and techniques that transform raw data into insights that can improve the operation of a business or other organization. BI is intended to support a measurement-based approach to making strategic and tactical decisions.

building a cube

The process of iterating through the source class for a cube and populating the fact table (and building the indexes for that table). See also synchronizing a cube.

For details, see Compiling and Building Cubes and Keeping the Cubes Current.

business metric

A two-dimensional array of data generated by a running production and generally providing data relevant to or about that production. Like pivot tables, business metrics can be displayed on a dashboard, within a widget. For information on creating production business metrics, see Developing Productions.

business rule

A concept that allows nontechnical users to change the behavior of business processes within a production. You
can use them in source expressions in cubes; see Details for Source Expressions. For details on production business
rules, see Developing Business Rules.

calculated measure

A measure that is based on other measures via an MDX expression. The phrase calculated measure is not standard in MDX, but this documentation uses it for brevity. Formally, a calculated measure is a calculated member that belongs to the Measures dimension.

calculated member

A member that is based on other members via an MDX expression. You can define tw o kinds of calculated
members:

- A calculated measure is a measure is based on other measures. (In MDX, each measure is a member of the Measures dimension.)

- For example, one measure might be defined as a second measure di vided by a third measure.

The phrase calculated measure is not standard in MDX, but this documentation uses it for brevity.

A non-measure calculated member typically aggregates together other non-measure members. Like other non-measure members, this calculated member is a group of records in the fact table.

See Defining Calculated Members .

compound cube

A special kind of subject area that combines multiple cube definitions (typically tw o) and that enables you to create pivot tables that contain elements from multiple cubes. See Defining Shared Dimensions and Compound
Cubes.

computed dimension

A special kind of Business Intelligence dimension whose members are computed at runtime via an SQL or MDX expression. See Defining Computed Dimensions .

Computed dimensions do not have any association with calculated members. A computed dimension is specific to Business Intelligence. A calculated member is a standard concept in MDX.

container class

A class that extends %DeepSee.UserLibrary.Container. This class can contain the definitions of pi vot tables, dashboards, and other Business Intelligence folder items. When you compile this class, the system generates those folder items, replacing any current definitions that the y might have. See Implementing InterSystems Business
Intelligence.

control

cube

An interactive element on a dashboard. Controls include drop-down lists and buttons.

An model of your data that defines elements that can be used in MDX queries. These elements determine how you can query your data, specifically , a set of specific records (such as patient records or transaction records). The set of records is determined by the source class for the cube. For an introduction, see Basic Concepts.

cube inheritance

A mechanism in Business Intelligence that enables you to define multiple similar cubes. This mechanism has no relationship to class inheritance. See Using Cube Inheritance.

custom listing

custom listing

A listing, specifically one of the follo wing special kinds of listings:

A listing that uses a custom SQL query that retrieves fields from some other table, not the source table used by the cube, and not a data connector. See Defining Listings .

A listing that consists of listing fields chosen by the user , in the Analyzer. See Performing Ad Hoc Analysis.

- dashboard

- An interactive display of data, particularly data that provides a high-level data of a business. See Creating Dashboards.

data connector

A class that extends %DeepSee.DataConnector. A data connector maps the results of an arbitrary SQL query into an object that can be used as the source of a cube. Typically, a data connector accesses external data not in an InterSystems database, but you can also use it to specify an SQL query against an InterSystems database, including an SQL query on a view. See Defining and Using Data Connectors .

detail listing

See listing.

dimension

A container for levels. A dimension contains one or more hierarchies, which in turn contain levels. For example, a single dimension might contain multiple hierarchies related to allergies. There is no formal relationship between two different hierarchies or between the levels of one hierarchy and the levels of another hierarchy. The practical purpose of a dimension is to define the def ault behavior of the levels that it contains — specifically the All level.

See Defining Dimensions, Hierarchies, and Le vels.

dimension table

The table in which Business Intelligence stores the members of a level and any properties they have. See Details for the Fact and Dimension Tables.

drill down

Examine a row of a pivot table and see the data for that row displayed in a more granular way. For example, a row might display data for a year, and you would drill down to see data for that year, broken out by month. Business Intelligence supports multiple forms of drill down. See Performing Ad Hoc Analysis.

Informally (although not in this documentation), the phrases drill down and drill through are sometimes used interchangeably, and it is wise to double-check which phrase is intended.

drill through

Formally, to drill through means to display a listing. Internally, the system uses the MDX DRILLTHROUGH statement when it displays a listing. See Performing Ad Hoc Analysis.

Informally (although not in this documentation), the phrases drill through and drill down are sometimes used interchangeably, and it is wise to double-check which phrase is intended.

expression

An expression (<expression> element) whose value is available while the system is building a row in the fact table. You can define an e xpression that uses complex or time-consuming logic, and then you can base multiple cube elements on the expression. Expressions are for use during cube build only and are provided for efficienc y.

See Other Options.

fact

A row in the fact table.

fact table

A generated structure that the system queries directly. When you compile a cube definition, the system generates a fact table class. When you build a cube, the system creates records for this table and indexes them. See Basic
Concepts.

filter

A restriction on the data. The system provides two simple ways to filter data: member -based filters and measurebased filters. You can combine these, and more complex filters are also possible, especially if you write MDX queries directly. For an introduction, see Filters.

folder item

Any of the following Business Intelligence items:

- Pivot tables

- Saved widgets

- Dashboards

- Themes Business Intelligence folder items are accessible within your IDE as generated .dfi files. If you are using Visual
Studio Code, you can access these pivot table definitions in the follo wing ways:

- Client-side editing: when a namespace is opened in the ObjectScript Explorer, view the .dfi files in the Other directory.

- Server-side editing: modify your workspace filters so that they show generated files and include the desired .dfi files.

geo listing

See map listing.

hierarchy

An organization of levels. Levels belong to hierarchies (which belong to dimensions). A hierarchy can contain only single level or can contain multiple levels. If it contains multiple levels, the higher levels of the hierarchy are less granular then the lower levels. That is, each member of a higher level contains a larger set of records than does a member of a lower level.

In casual usage, a higher level is called the parent of the lower level. However, it is useful to remember that the hierarchy is a actually a hierarchy among members. Thus it is more accurate to state that a member of the higher level is the parent of one or more members of the lower level. Conversely, any member of a lower level is the child of exactly one member of the higher level.

Hierarchies provide additional features beyond those provided by levels; see Hierarchies and Dimensions and
Defining Dimensions, Hierarchies, and Le vels.

KPI

A class based on %DeepSee.KPI. In most cases, a KPI uses a query and displays a result set. Like pivot tables, KPIs can be displayed on a dashboard, within a widget. You can also use KPIs as building blocks for calculated members (including calculated measures). Start with Defining Basic KPIs .

KPI

level

A cube element that enables you to group records. A level consists of members, each of which is a set of records. See Basic Concepts and Details of Defining Le vels.

list-based level

A level that is based upon a list value. For example, a patient can have multiple diagnoses. The Diagnoses level groups patients by diagnosis. With a list level, it is possible for a given record of the source class to have multiple values and thus for that record to belong to multiple members of the level.

listing

An SQL query that accesses the lowest-level records associated with one or more cells of a pivot table. See Defining Listings .

listing field

A <listingField> element defined in a cube definition. Users can select the listing fields to include, when they create custom listings in the Analyzer. See Defining Listing Fields .

This phrase can also refer more generally to any field in an y listing.

listing group

A class that defines a group of listings. Listing groups are created in the Listing Group Manager . The purpose of this tool is to enable you (and your customers, if appropriate) to define listings outside of cube definitions and without needing access to the Architect. See Defining Listing Groups .

map listing

A listing that contains location data and is displayed as a map. Each pin on the map corresponds to a source record.

Important:

A map listing uses the Google Maps API. Be sure that your usage of this API is consistent with the Terms of Use, which you can access via a link displayed in this listing.

Note that in order to use the Google Maps API, you must obtain an API key. See Specifying Basic Settings.

map widget

A dashboard widget that contains location data and is displayed as a map. Each pin on the map corresponds to a member of a level, particularly a level that refers to locations.

Important:

A map widget uses the Google Maps API. Be sure that your usage of this API is consistent with the Terms of Use, which you can access via a link displayed in this widget.

Note that in order to use the Google Maps API, you must obtain an API key. See Specifying Basic Settings.

MultiDimensional eXpressions, a standard query language for OLAP (online analytical processing) databases and used in many BI applications. See Using InterSystems MDX and InterSystems MDX Reference.

measure

A cube element that (with rare exceptions) aggregates values across multiple records. Each measure is based on a source value, which is either a class property or an ObjectScript expression. The definition of a measure also includes an aggregation function, which specifies ho w to aggregate values for this measure. See Basic Concepts and Defining Measures .

member

A set of records. Every level has one or members. See Basic Concepts and Details of Defining Le vels.

named filter

A reusable filter that is defined in the Analyzer. See Filtering Pivot Tables.

named set

A reusable MDX set that is defined within a cube. See Defining Named Sets .

NLP dimension

A special kind of dimension that analyzes an NLP measure, which in turn is a measure based on unstructured text. See Using Text Analytics in Cubes.

NLP measure

A special kind of measure that is based on unstructured text. You cannot display NLP measures directly in pivot tables. Their purpose is to provide data for use by NLP dimensions. See Using Text Analytics in Cubes.

pivot table

An interactive, drillable display of data, generally with rows and columns, designed for specific user roles or for specific areas of your user interf ace. A pivot table is based on an MDX query that is executed at runtime can respond to input such as filter selections made by the user . Internally it obtains values from a cube. See Using the
Analyzer.

pivot variable

An element that is intended to be used in pivot tables, specifically , in selected parts of the query that defines the pivot table. When a dashboard displays the pivot table, that dashboard can include a control with which the user can change the value of the corresponding pivot variable. See Defining and Using Pi vot Variables.

Pivot variables are entirely different from runtime variables.

portlet

A custom widget that can be displayed on dashboards. For information on creating portlets, see Implementing InterSystems Business Intelligence.

plugin

plugin

A specialized form of KPI that defines one or more computations to use in the Analyzer and in queries. Plug-ins are especially appropriate for complex or time-consuming computations. For example, you might have a compu-
tation that uses several different parts of the source record, as well as external information; a plug-in would be
suitable in this case. See Defining Plug-ins .

property

A value that is specific to a member of a given level. If a level has a property, then each member of that level has
a value for that property; other levels do not have values for the property. You can use properties in queries in
much the same way that you use measures. In Business Intelligence, you can also use properties for other purposes such as controlling member names and controlling the order in which member are sorted. See Defining Properties .

quality measure

A quality measure is similar to a calculated measure because it is defined by a formula that combines MDX expressions. You specify the subject area or subject areas in which it is available, and you can control whether the quality measure is published (and thus available in the Analyzer). Each quality measure is a subclass of
%DeepSee.QualityMeasure.QualityMeasure.

For information, see Defining Quality Measures .

related cube

A cube whose dimensions, hierarchies, and levels are available within another cube, because there is a relationship between the two cubes.

relationship

A connection between two cubes that makes the dimensions of one cube available in the other cube (and possibly vice versa). If you define relationships, you can define a le vel once rather than multiple times, which minimizes the sizes of fact tables and their indexes. See Cube-Cube Relationships.

runtime variable

A special element that is intended for use as the default value of a filter on a dashboard (currently this is their only use). The definition of a runtime v ariable is an ObjectScript expression that is evaluated at runtime. See Configuring
Settings.

Runtime variables are entirely different from pivot variables.

searchable measure

A measure that enables you to apply a filter that considers the values in the source records. Searchable measures are an InterSystems extension to MDX. In standard MDX, a filter can be based only on members. See Defining
Measures.

Selective Build

A cube build option that allows you to build a specific le vel, measure, or relationship in a cube, without having to rebuild the entire cube. See Using Selective Build.

set

A list of multiple MDX items, typically used for rows or columns of a pivot table. The items can be any combination of literal values, members, and tuples. For an introduction, see Working with Sets. For reference information, see
Set Expressions.

shared dimension

A dimension that can be used in more than one cube. That is, more than one cube can use members of the dimension for rows or columns or for filtering. A dimension can be shared formally or informally. If the dimension is shared formally, you can define a compound cube that combines the cubes that use this dimension. See Defining Shared Dimensions and Compound Cubes.

source class, source records

The source class is the class that contains the data upon which a cube is based. Every cube has a source class, which is usually a persistent class. A source class has a set of source records. For an introduction, see Basic Concepts.

star table

See dimension table.

subject area

A view of a cube with optional overrides. A subject area uses the fact table and related tables of the associated cube and does not require independent updates. You define subject areas to enable users to focus on smaller sets of data without the need for multiple cubes. See Defining Subject Areas.

synchronizing a cube

The process of updating the fact table and indexes for a cube, based on incremental changes to the source class. See Compiling and Building Cubes and Keeping the Cubes Current.

See also building a cube.

term list

A simple (but extendable) list of key and value pairs. Term lists provide a way to customize a Business Intelligence model without programming. See Defining Term Lists.

time dimension and time level

A time dimension is a dimension that contains time levels. A time level groups data by a date or time value in the source data.

tuple

A type of MDX value that consists of an intersection of members. If the tuple refers to each dimension in the cube, the tuple is fully qualified . Otherwise, it is partially qualified .

For an introduction, see Tuples and Cubes. For reference information, see Tuple Expressions.

unstructured data

Data that is written as text in a human language such as English or French. The Analytics Engine analyzes unstructured data. For a general introduction, see Conceptual Overview.

You can use unstructured data within cubes, if the source table for a cube includes a property that contains unstructured data. See Using Text Analytics in Cubes.

widget

A rectangular area that lies within a dashboard and that (in most cases) displays data obtained from Business Intelligence. See Creating Dashboards.
