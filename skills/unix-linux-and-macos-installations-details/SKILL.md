# UNIX®, Linux, and macOS Installation Details

AIX® Platform Notes

The default settings of several AIX® parameters can adversely affect performance. The settings and recommendations are
detailed for the following:

- I/O Pacing Parameters

- File System Mount Option

- Memory Management Parameters

- Required C/C++ Runtime Libraries

- Shared Library Environment Variable for InterSystems IRIS Shared Library Support

- Use of Raw Ethernet

- 1.1 I/O Pacing Parameters AIX® implements an I/O pacing algorithm that may hinder InterSystems IRIS write daemons. In AIX® 5.2 and AIX®
5.3, I/O pacing is automatically enabled when using HACMP clustering; beginning in AIX® 6.1, however, I/O pacing is
enabled on all systems and the default high-water mark is set higher than in earlier releases.

If write daemons are slowing or stalling, you may have to adjust the high-water mark; for information, see Disk-I/O Pacing
in the IBM AIX documentation.

Important:

Beginning in AIX® 6.1, you should not have to make any high-water mark adjustments.

If you have questions about the impact to your system, however, contact the InterSystems Worldwide Response Center (WRC) or your AIX® supplier before making any changes. These recommendations apply to both JFS and Enhanced JFS (JFS2) file systems.

### 1.2 File System Mount Option

Different mount options may improve performance for some workloads.

Note:

Non-InterSystems IRIS workloads that benefit from file system caching (for e backups and/or file copies) are slo wed by the cio mount option.

xample, operating system-level

To improve recovery speed using the IRIS.WIJ file after a hard shutdo wn or system crash, InterSystems recommends a mount option that includes file system b uffering (for example, rw) for the file system that contains the

IRIS.WIJ file.

For information about mount options, see mount Command in the IBM AIX documentation.

### 1.3 Memory Management Parameters

The number of file systems and the amount of acti vity on them can limit the number of memory structures available to JFS or JFS2, and delay I/O operations waiting for those memory structures.

To monitor these metrics, issue a vmstat -vs command, wait two minutes, and issue another vmstat -vs command. The
output looks similar to the following:

# vmstat -vs
## 1310720 memory pages 1217707 lruable pages
## 144217 free pages 1 memory pools
## 106158 pinned pages 80.0 maxpin percentage
### 20.0 minperm percentage 80.0 maxperm percentage
### 62.8 numperm percentage 764830 file pages
### 0.0 compressed percentage 0 compressed pages
### 32.1 numclient percentage 80.0 maxclient percentage
## 392036 client pages 0 remote pageouts scheduled
## 0 pending disk I/Os blocked with no pbuf 5060 paging space I/Os blocked with no psbuf
## 5512714 filesystem I/Os blocked with no fsbuf 194775 client filesystem I/Os blocked with no fsbuf
## 0 external pager filesystem I/Os blocked with no fsbuf

If you see an increase in the following parameters, increase the values for better InterSystems IRIS performance:

- pending disk I/Os blocked with no pbuf

- paging space I/Os blocked with no psbuf

- filesystem I/Os bloc ked with no fsbuf

- client filesystem I/Os bloc ked with no fsbuf

- external pager filesystem I/Os bloc ked with no fsbuf

When increasing these parameters from the default values:

1.

Increase the current value by 50%.

2. Check the vmstat output.

3. Run vmstat twice, two minutes apart.

4.

If the field is still increasing, increase ag ain by the same amount; continue this step until the field stops increasing
between vmstat reports.

Important:

Change both the current and the reboot values, and check the vmstat output regularly because I/O patterns may change over time (hours, days, or weeks).

See the following IBM web pages for more detailed information:

- For a complete description of each of the fields reported by vmstat, see vmstat Command in the IBM AIX documentation.

- For instructions on how to increase these parameters, see VMM page replacement tuning in the IBM AIX documentation.

- For a complete description of managing I/O tunable parameters, see ioo Command in the IBM AIX documentation.

### 1.4 AIX® Tunable Parameters

#### 1.4.1 AIX® Interprocess Communication Tunable Parameters

The following table lists the tunable parameters for the IBM pSeries AIX® 5.2 operating system. None of the following listed parameters require tuning because each is dynamically adjusted as needed by the kernel. For more information, see Interprocess communication tunable parameters in the IBM AIX documentation.

Maximum value of 32767

Maximum value of 256 MB for 32-bit processes and 0x80000000u for 64-bit

Minimum value of 1

Maximum value of 4096

#### 1.4.2 maxuproc

maxuproc, which specifies the maximum number of processes than can be started by a single nonroot user , is a tunable parameter that can be adjusted as described in this subsection.

If this parameter is set too low then various components of the operating system can fail as more and more users attempt
to start processes; these failures include loss of CSP pages, background tasks failing, etc. Therefore, you should set the
maxuproc parameter to be higher than the maximum number of processes that might be started by a nonroot user (including interactive users, web server processes, and anything that might start a process).

Note:

Do not set the value excessively high because this value protects a server from a runaway application that is cre-
ating new processes unnecessarily; however, setting it too low causes unexplained problems.

InterSystems suggests that you set maxuproc to be double your expected maximum process count which gives a margin of error but still provides protection from runaway processes. For example, if your system has 1000 interactive users and often runs 500 background processes, then a value of at least 3000 would be a good choice.

The maxuproc value can be examined and changed either from the command line or from the smit/smitty administrator
utilities, both as root user, as follows:

- From the command line, view the current setting:

# lsattr -E -l sys0 -a maxuproc

then modify the value:

# chdev -l sys0 -a maxuproc=NNNNNN

where NNNNNN is the new value.

- From the administrator utility smit (or smitty) choose System Environments > Change / Show Characteristics of Operating System > Maximum number of PROCESSES allowed per user.

If you increase the value of maxuproc, the change is effective immediately. If you decrease the value of maxuproc, the change does not take effect until the next system reboot. In both cases the change persists over system reboots.

#### 1.4.3 udp_sendspace

InterSystems IRIS sends UDP datagrams up to 16536 bytes in size. To support this, the udp_sendspace tunable for your system must be set to at least 16536. For details on UDP and the udp_sendspace tunable, see UDP tuning in the IBM AIX documentation.

#### 1.4.4 Required C/C++ Runtime Libraries

You must ensure that the required C/C++ runtime is installed on your IBM AIX® system before installing InterSystems
IRIS.

InterSystems IRIS for AIX is compiled using the IBM XL C/C++ for AIX 16.1.x and 17.1.x compilers. If the system on which you are installing InterSystems IRIS does not have the corresponding version of the runtime already installed, you must install it. You can download the latest 16.1.x and 17.1.x runtimes from the Fix list for XL C/C++ Runtime for AIX on the IBM Support website.

#### 1.4.5 Shared Library Environment Variable for InterSystems IRIS Shared Library Support

The InterSystems IRIS shared library support contain a batch file that references an y installed C linker.

If you have either the standard UNIX® C libraries or any proprietary C libraries defined in the LIBPATH environment variable, then your environment is ready.

If not, append the paths for the standard UNIX® C libraries to LIBPATH; these paths are /usr/lib and /lib.

#### 1.4.6 Use of Raw Ethernet

In order to use Raw Ethernet, an IBM AIX® machine must have the DLPI (Data Link Provider Interface) packages installed. If the machine does not have the DLPI packages, obtain them from your IBM provider and create DLPI devices through
the following procedure:

1. Log in as root.

2.

In the PSE drivers section of the /etc/pse.conf file, uncomment the four lines that refer to the DLPI dri vers.

3. Save the file.

4. Restart the computer.

If the DLPI devices are not installed, the EthernetAddress() method of the %SYSTEM.INetInfo class returns a null string rather than information about the Ethernet device.

Red Hat Linux Platform Notes

This topic includes the information on the following adjustments:

- Shared Memory Limit

- 2.1 Shared Memory Limits

- Depending on your version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux you may need to set kernel parameters related to shared memory.

RHEL 9

RHEL 8

shmmax (maximum size shared memory segment) — The default for this parameter is sufficient.

shmall (maximum size of total shared memory system wide) — This should be set to 18446744073692774399 (in bytes).

shmmax (maximum size shared memory segment) — This should be set to 18446744073692774399 (in bytes).

shmall (maximum size of total shared memory system wide) — This should be set to 18446744073692774399 (in bytes).

Changing the Kernel Parameters

You can change these parameters in the proc file system without a restart. The new memory limits remain in effect until you restart the Red Hat Linux system.

For example, type the following command:

$ echo 18446744073692774399 >/proc/sys/kernel/shmmax

You can put this command into a startup script.

Alternatively, you can use sysctl(8), if available, to set this parameter permanently. Add a line to the/etc/sysctl.conf
similar to the following:

kernel.shmmax = 18446744073692774399

Red Hat Linux Platform Notes

This file is usually processed at startup, b ut sysctl can also be called explicitly later.

For more information, reference Adjusting kernel parameters for database servers in the Red Hat Documentation.

msgmni

The msgmni parameter may also be set too low if you are running more than one instance of InterSystems IRIS on a machine. Set this value to three times the number of instances of InterSystems IRIS that run simultaneously on your system.

Other Parameters

Other parameters are sufficiently sized for an InterSystems IRIS application. To view the values of other parameters, /usr/src/linux/include/asm-xxx/shmparam.h and /usr/src/linux/include/linux/sem.h. look in the files

### 2.2 Locked-in Memory

On Linux platforms, if shared memory is allocated in huge pages, the pages are automatically locked in memory and no further action is required. See the Configuring Huge P ages on Linux section in this chapter for information about allocating huge pages.

If not using huge pages, you can configure InterSystems IRIS to lock the shared memory se gment in memory to prevent paging. This is described in the LockSharedMemory section of the “memlock” entry in the Configur ation Parameter File
Reference.

Otherwise, you must increase the maximum size that may be locked into memory. View the current value using the ulimit
command:

For example, to display all current limits:

bash$ ulimit -a core file size (blocks, -c) unlimited data seg size ( KBytes, -d) unlimited file size (blocks, -f) unlimited pending signals (-i) 1024 max locked memory (KBytes, -l) 32 <---------- CHANGE TO unlimited max memory size (KBytes, -m) unlimited open files (-n) 1024 pipe size (512 bytes, -p) 8 POSIX message queues (bytes, -q) 819200 stack size ( KBytes, -s) 10240 cpu time (seconds, -t) unlimited max user processes (-u) 49000 virtual memory ( KBytes, -v) unlimited file locks (-x) unlimited

To display only max locked memory, use the -l option:

bash$ ulimit -l 32

Set max locked memory to unlimited. If you have privileges, you can alter the value directly using the ulimit command;
however, it is better to update the memlock parameter in the /etc/security/limits.conf file. If the memlock limit is too low, Linux reports a ENOMEM - "Not enough memory" error, which does not make the cause obvious. The actual memory
is allocated; it is the lock that fails.

For more information, see memlock in the Configur ation Parameter File Reference.

### 2.3 Using Kerberos

To use Kerberos on the Red Hat Linux platform, you must install the krb5-devel package in addition to the krb5-libs package. Installing krb5-devel establishes the required symbolic links for using Kerberos. The package is required for production environments, not only development environments. See the Red Hat Network web site for more information about these components.

SUSE Linux Platform Notes

This topic includes the information on the following adjustments:

- I/O Scheduler

- Shared Memory Limits

- 3.1 I/O Scheduler

- The I/O scheduler for SUSE Linux is responsible for ordering the I/O requests submitted to a storage device. On SUSE Linux 15, it may default to BFQ (Budget Fair Queueing) which is known to cause performance issues with InterSystems IRIS. InterSystems recommends changing this setting to NONE. For details on changing the I/O scheduler, see the SUSE documentation: Tuning I/O Performance.

Note:

Setting the I/O scheduler to NONE may not be optimal for all use cases. Users should test the system’s application workload after making any changes.

### 3.2 Shared Memory Limits

The default shared memory limits (shhmax and shmall) on SUSE Linux 32-bit platforms are too small for InterSystems IRIS, and can be changed in the proc file system without a restart.

InterSystems IRIS uses shared memory for database buffers, global buffers, routine buffers, as well as license use. If the machine is being used only for InterSystems IRIS, InterSystems recommends setting the shared memory to approximately half the total memory. For more information, see Memory Planning in System Resource Planning and Managment, as well as Memory and Startup Settings and Determining License Capacity and Usage in the System Administration Guide.

Note:

The recommendations to change the shared memory limits do not apply to SUSE Linux 64-bit systems.

SUSE Linux Platform Notes

For example, to allow 512 MB, type the following commands:

#sets shmall and shmmax shared memory
echo 536870912 >/proc/sys/kernel/shmall #Sets shmall to 512 MB echo 536870912 >/proc/sys/kernel/shmmax #Sets shmmax to 512 MB

You can put these commands into a script that is run at startup. The SUSE Linux product documentation recommends you put the commands in the /etc/init.d/boot.local script file.

You can change the settings for the system memory user limits by modifying a file called
to the following:

/etc/profile.local. Add lines similar

#sets user limits (ulimit) for system memory resources
ulimit -v 512000 #set virtual (swap) memory to 512 MB ulimit -m 512000 #set physical memory to 512 MB

In this same file, you can permanently change the v alues for the PATH and CLASSPATH parameters by adding lines similar
to the following:

#sets env values PATH and CLASSPATH
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/iris/bin:/path/to/j2sdk/bin:/.
export CLASSPATH=
$CLASSPATH:/iris/dev/java/lib/JDK18/intersystems-jdbc-3.0.0.jar.

Important:

To avoid the risk of losing your changes during system upgrades, do not change the /etc/profile file.

### 3.3 Locked-in Memory

On Linux platforms, if shared memory is allocated in huge pages, they are automatically locked in memory and no further action is required. See Configuring Huge P ages on Linux for information about allocating huge pages.

If not using huge pages, you can configure InterSystems IRIS to lock the shared memory se gment in memory to prevent paging. This is described in the LockSharedMemory section of the “memlock” entry in the Configur ation Parameter File
Reference.

Otherwise, you must increase the maximum size that may be locked into memory. See the Locked-in Memory section of the Red Hat Linux Platform Notes in this chapter for instructions.

### 3.4 Using Kerberos

To use Kerberos on the SUSE Linux platform, you must install the krb5-devel package in addition to the krb5-libs package. Installing krb5-devel establishes the required symbolic links for using Kerberos. The package is required for production environments, not only development environments. See the SUSE documentation web site for more information about these components.

Ubuntu Platform Notes

This topic includes the information on the following adjustments:

- Semaphore Deletion Setting

### 4.1 Semaphore Deletion Setting

Under some circumstances, the OS may delete an instance’s semaphores when the instance owner connects to an Ubuntu host, for example using SSH. To prevent this, edit the /etc/systemd/logind.conf file and change RemoveIPC=yes (the default) to RemoveIPC=no.

Updating to a newer version of Ubuntu may revert RemoveIPC to the default value of yes. After updating Ubuntu, be sure to change RemoveIPC to avoid unwanted semaphore deletion.

Installing a Web Server on UNIX®, Linux, and macOS

Before installing InterSystems IRIS, you should install a supported web server in order to access web applications, including the Management Portal. The installation procedure will vary depending on the web server you choose. For details, you should refer to your web server’s documentation.

In many cases, the InterSystems IRIS installer can automatically configure a ne w or upgraded instance to serve its built-in web applications using your web server. For details, see Connect Your Web Server Automatically.

If you would like to manually set up your web server, you can do this after installing IRIS. For details, see Connect Your Web Server Manually.

If you intend on configuring the web serv er manually (or not configuring a web serv er at all) and you are performing an unattended installation, make sure that you set the parameter ISC_PACKAGE_WEB_CONFIGURE="N". Otherwise, the installation will attempt to automatically configure your web serv er and will fail if a web server is not detected.

Important:

InterSystems recommends using the Apache httpd web server because it can be automatically configured during the installation process. Make sure it is installed and running before beginning the installation process. In most cases, it is not necessary to manually configure the Apache web server.

Determining Owners and Groups

The installation process prompts for the following user and group information:

- Owner of the instance

- Effective user for the InterSystems IRIS superserver and its jobs

- Effective group for InterSystems IRIS processes

- Group allowed to start and stop the instance For more information about these categories, see the UNIX® User and Group Identifications section in the “Using Inter- Systems IRIS on UNIX®, Linux, and macOS ” chapter of System Administration Guide.

Important:

InterSystems IRIS must set user, group, and other permissions on files that it installs. To accomplish this, InterSystems IRIS sets umask to 022 for the installation process - do not modify the umask until the installation is complete.

The user account you identify as Owner of the instance and the group you identify as Group allowed to start and stop the instance must both exist before you begin installation. If an entry you provide at one of these prompts does not exist, the prompt is repeated, so verify that the user and group you intend to provide exist before you begin installation.

If your operating system contains the useradd and groupadd utilities (or mkgroup and mkuser on AIX®), the system creates the account for the effective user for InterSystems IRIS superserver and the effective group for InterSystems IRIS processes, if the entries you provide do not exist. However, if these utilities are not present and an entry you provide does not exist, the prompt is repeated. If you are not sure that your system has these utilities, verify that the user and group you intend to provide exist before you begin installation.

Note:

If your operating system uses Network Information Services (NIS) or another form of network-based user/group database, the groupadd and useradd utilities (or mkgroup and mkuser on AIX®) may create a local user and/or group that could conflict with e xisting entries in the network database. To avoid this problem, it may be best to create the InterSystems IRIS effective group and effective user in your network database using the appropriate administration tools prior to beginning installation, rather than allowing the utilities to create them.

Note:

If you choose a non-root user as the Owner of the instance, then the installation mount point cannot be mounted with nosuid set. Trying to mount with nosuid set with a non-root owner may result in a Permission denied error.

While performing a custom UNIX® reinstallation or upgrade, you will have the option to change the Effective group for InterSystems IRIS processes from the original installation. If you specify a different effective group, the system will update the ownership of all files in the IRIS installation directory that were pre viously owned by the original effective group to

Determining Owners and Groups

the new effective group. Please note that you are responsible for updating the ownership of any files created outside the IRIS installation directory to ensure continued access.

Tools used on UNIX® operating systems to display process ownership may or may not show effective versus real ownership. See the “UNIX® Users, Groups and Permissions ” chapter of the System Administration Guide for details on how InterSystems IRIS assigns permissions.

Installing as a Nonroot User

When installing InterSystems IRIS in a production environment, InterSystems recommends using root privileges. It is possible to run an InterSystems IRIS installation without root privilege, but these installations have several limitations. The following sections describe these limitations and the differences from a standard InterSystems IRIS installation.

- Why InterSystems IRIS Installation Uses Root

- Nonroot Installation Limitations

- Nonroot Installation Differences

Important:

Root privilege should only be used when installing InterSystems IRIS. Once the installation is complete, all users should interact with InterSystems IRIS using nonroot privileges.

### 7.1 Why InterSystems IRIS Installation Uses Root

InterSystems IRIS is typically installed using root and operated using nonroot privileges. Several features require root access, but the majority of processes run as a user or group that you specify during installation. The purpose of these users and groups, and how they use root, is described in UNIX Users, Groups, and Permissions.

InterSystems IRIS processes that utilize root privileges include:

- The Virtual IP process, which has root as its effective user ID (UID) to modify network settings on the operating system.

- The Control Process, which has the instance owner as its effective UID and root as its real UID. The real UID is used to get large pages at startup and to communicate with other InterSystems IRIS processes.

- The startup executables, which have root as the effective UID.

Installing InterSystems IRIS as root also enhances security by ensuring that only users with root privileges can modify or replace the file structure.

### 7.2 Nonroot Installation Limitations

While nonroot installations of InterSystems IRIS are supported, there are several features that cannot be used in instances
installed in this way:

- The Web Gateway cannot be configured to use an e xternal web server.

Installing as a Nonroot User

- A mirror Virtual IP cannot be used.

Note:

For alternative methods of routing network traffic, such as using a netw ork load balancer or the Web Gateway, see Redirecting Application Connections Following Failover or Disaster Recovery.

- There is no option to specify the instance owner and group allowed to start and stop InterSystems IRIS during installation (as described in Determining Owners and Groups).

- There is no group access. All instance files, including the re gistry, are owned and can be read, written, and executed by the installing user only.

For example, where a standard instance might have:

-rws--x--- 5 root develop 43282 Aug 28 07:52 irismgr -r-x--s--x 1 <nonroot-user> irisusr 23058 Aug 28 07:52 irisuxsession

a nonroot instance would have:

-rwx------ 5 <installing-user> develop 43282 Aug 28 07:52 irismgr -r-x------ 1 <installing-user> develop 23058 Aug 28 07:52 irisuxsession

The registry is located in the directory specified by IRISSYS, and nonroot instances are found in that registry. (The iris executable is also in that directory.) Only nonroot instances may be in the nonroot registry. Any attempt to access a rootinstalled instance from a nonroot registry fails. Conversely, a nonroot instance may be defined in a root-re gistry, but an attempt to access the instance by any user other than the owner fails.

Note:

InterSystems recommends that the registry be placed in a directory that is local to the machine on which the instance is installed, not an NFS directory. Note that the standard location /usr/local/etc is such a directory.

### 7.3 Nonroot Installation Differences

Along with the feature limitations described above, there are several apparent differences between root and nonroot Inter-
Systems IRIS installations:

- The IRISSYS environment variable must be defined as an e xisting directory writable by the installing user, and must be present during installation and all instance operations.

- The ISCAgent is installed in the directory specified by IRISSYS.

- Note:

- For information about starting the ISCAgent for a nonroot instance, see Starting the ISCAgent for Nonroot Instances on UNIX®/Linux and macOS Systems in the “Mirroring” chapter of the High Availability Guide.

Only the installing user’s account can access and operate the InterSystems IRIS instance.

All InterSystems IRIS executables and processes run as the installing user.

The following describes the parameters used with the irisinstall_silent script in unattended installation. Some parameters include a default value which the installation uses if the parameter is omitted.

ISC_CPF_MERGE_FILE=”<location>"

Specifies the location of the configuration mer

ge file when performing a configuration mer

ge.

For more information, see Automating Configuration of InterSystems IRIS with Configuration Mer

ge.

ISC_PACKAGE_INSTANCENAME="<instancename>"

Specifies the Superserv er port to be used by the instance being installed.

Unattended Installation Packages

The installation scripts for each component are contained in the packages directory below the directory containing the irisinstall_silent script. Each package is in its own directory, and each package directory contains a manifest.isc file defining prerequisite packages for the package in that directory.

The standard_install package is the starting point for a server install in which all packages are installed. To define a custom
package, you can use the manifest.isc file for the standard_install package as a template, as follows:

1. Copy the standard_install directory to a new directory.

For example, copy it to a directory named custom_install; initially, the manifest.isc file in the ne w directory is similar
to the following:

#This is the target for a standard (non-client-only) install
package: standard_install prerequisite: install_mode prerequisite: database_server prerequisite: databases prerequisite: gadget prerequisite: fop prerequisite: renderserver prerequisite: printserver prerequisite: excelexporter prerequisite: callin_components prerequisite: client_components prerequisite: addenda prerequisite: install_confirmation prerequisite: copyright

2.

In the new directory, modify the manifest.isc file as follo ws:

- Set the package key to the value of the directory name (required).

- Add and/or remove prerequisites for your custom installation.

For example, in the following manifest.isc file, the v alue of the package key has been changed to match the directory name (custom_install).

#This is the target for a custom (non-client-only) install
package: custom_install prerequisite: install_mode prerequisite: database_server prerequisite: gadget prerequisite: fop prerequisite: renderserver prerequisite: printserver prerequisite: excelexporter prerequisite: callin_components prerequisite: client_components prerequisite: addenda prerequisite: install_confirmation prerequisite: copyright

Unattended Installation Packages

Then you can specify the new custom package when performing unattended installations; for example: sudo
ISC_PACKAGE_INSTANCENAME="MyIris" ./irisinstall_silent custom_install.

Note:

See the Adding UNIX® Installation Packages to an InterSystems IRIS Distribution appendix for information about creating your own UNIX® installation packages and adding them to an InterSystems IRIS distribution.

Starting InterSystems IRIS

For most installations, InterSystems IRIS starts automatically when the install completes. If you need to start InterSystems IRIS, first log in to your operating system, then start InterSystems IRIS using the

iris command:

iris start <instance_name>

Use the iris command to start and stop InterSystems IRIS. It is described in greater detail in the Controlling InterSystems IRIS Instances section of the System Administration Guide.

Note:

If the permissions on all elements of the path to the mgr subdirectory do not provide read access to the irisusr
group (at a minimum), the instance fails to fully start and the following message is recorded in messages.log:
Element of path manager_subdirectory could not be read (errno 2).

Once InterSystems IRIS is started, initiate an InterSystems IRIS session using the iris terminal command, as described in Connecting to an InterSystems IRIS Instance in the “Using Multiple Instances of InterSystems IRIS” chapter of the System
Administration Guide:

iris terminal <instname> [parameters]

Where instname is the instance name that you chose during the installation.

For more information, see the “Using InterSystems IRIS on UNIX®, Linux, and macOS” chapter of the System Administration Guide.

Adjustments for Large Number of Concurrent Processes on macOS

Make the following adjustments if you are running a system that requires a large number of processes or telnet logins:

1. Remote connections — The number of pty (pseudo terminal) connections is limited to 128 system-wide. If your

applications count on telnet or other pty-using connections for users to access, keep this in mind.

2. Number of processes — If the pty limit is not a problem, but you need to run a larger number of processes, there are

limits to that as well.

- System-wide process limits — The kern.maxproc, kern.maxprocperuid parameters are set to 532 and 100 by
default. You can change them using the following commands:

administrator$ sudo sysctl -w kern.maxproc=2500 kern.maxproc: 2065 -> 2500 administrator$ sudo sysctl -w kern.maxprocperuid=2500 kern.maxprocperuid: 2000 -> 2500

administrator$ sysctl -a | grep maxproc kern.maxproc = 2500 kern.maxprocperuid = 2500

Note, however, that 2500 is the absolute unchangeable upper limit.

Installing a Development Environment

InterSystems IRIS does not include a development environment; therefore, you must install a supported IDE.

Adding UNIX® Installation Packages to an InterSystems IRIS Distribution

This appendix describes how to add a new UNIX® installation package to an existing InterSystems IRIS® data platform distribution. It is presented in the form of a tutorial in which we create a simple package that copies additional files into the InterSystems IRIS instance directory.

Note:

Because install packages are implemented through UNIX® shell scripts, you can also write packages that perform much more complex operations.

### 13.1 UNIX® Installation Package Tutorial

Suppose we have written an InterSystems Callout shared library (see the “Creating an InterSystems Callout Library” chapter in Using the Callout Gateway) to connect to an imaging device named Foo9000. We compile this library as libfoo9000.so and want to install it with InterSystems IRIS. In addition, we want the installation to prompt users to provide the network server name for the device (Foo9000) to which we want the library to connect. This information is stored in a configuration file in the InterSystems IRIS instance’

s install-dir\mgr directory.

We start with an existing InterSystems IRIS kit:

~/kit:>ls irisinstall cplatname docs lgpl.txt NOTICE copyright.pdf dist kitlist LICENSE package

... and our compiled library (libfoo9000.so):

~/lib:>ls libfoo9000.so

First, we need to choose a location in the kit to store our library, then copy the library to that location. By convention,
platform-specific libraries go in dist/package/platform directories (for example, ~/kit/dist/foo9000/lnxsusex64):

~/kit:>cd dist ~/kit/dist:>mkdir foo9000 ~/kit/dist:>cd foo9000 ~/kit/dist/foo9000:>mkdir lnxsusex64 ~/kit/dist/foo9000:>cd lnxsusex64 ~/kit/dist/foo9000/lnxsusex64:>cp ~/lib/libfoo9000.so .

Next, we need to create the installation package directory and add the manifest.isc file (which describes the package) to it. In its simplest form, the manifest.isc file includes only the name of the package, which must be identical to the name of the package directory (foo9000).

~/kit/package:>mkdir foo9000 ~/kit/package:>cd foo9000 ~/kit/package/foo9000:>emacs manifest.isc package: foo9000

Without any content the package does not do anything, but in this tutorial we want to do the following:

1. Prompt users for the name of the server hosting the Foo9000.

2. Save this information in a configuration file in the

install-dir\mgr directory.

3. Copy the library (libfoo9000.so) into the instance binary directory.

The package installer performs actions in phases, the most important of which are the following:

- “parameters ” phase

- “install” phase

Note:

Packages can contain Bourne shell scripts, with the same name as the phase, for each phase. The package installer runs the script for each package at the appropriate time during the phase. If your package script successfully
completes its given phase, it returns an error code of 0 explicitly or implicitly via its final command; otherwise
it returns a non-zero error code.

The “parameters” phase collects information necessary for the package's installation, typically by prompting users, and should not make any permanent changes to the system. Users are typically given the opportunity to cancel the installation
after the “parameters” phase; if they do so, the installation should have had no effect on their system.

The “install” phase modifies the system. During the install phase users should not be prompted for information because the install may be unattended or automated.

Some packages do not require information from users and, therefore, do not need a “parameters” script. If the script for a particular phase is not included in a package, no actions are performed for that package during the phase.

Here is our first attempt at a “parameters ” script for the foo9000 package:

~/kit/package/foo9000:>emacs parameters
#!/bin/sh
echo "Please enter host name of the Foo9000 imaging server: " read host
echo "Host $host entered."

If we try running this script, as follows, we see that it does indeed prompt us for the host name. which it records in the host
variable:

~/kit/package/foo9000:>sh parameters
Please enter host name of the Foo9000 imaging server:
host1 Host host1 entered.

However, what do we do with the host value once we've acquired it? When the script is finished running, it will be lost and unavailable when we need to write it to the configuration file during the

“install” phase.

Note:

Remember that we do not want to create the configuration file no w because the “parameters” phase should have no effect on the user's system.

The package installer provides a convenient pair of functions – Import and Export – that let multiple phases and multiple packages share information. We can use these functions by including them in the parameters.include file through the usual
shell script mechanism:

UNIX® Installation Package Tutorial

#!/bin/sh
. parameters.include echo "Please enter host name of the Foo9000 imaging server: " read host
echo "Host $host entered."
Export foo9000.host $host

The Export function takes the name of a parameter variable to export and its value, typically from a variable local to the script. The Import function works in reverse: the first ar gument is the local variable into which you want to import the previously exported value, and the second argument is the name of the parameter variable to which it was exported.

Note:

By convention, parameter variables are given a name of package name.local variable name (for example, foo9000.host).

Since our “parameters ” script now collects all the Foo9000 information needed to complete the installation, we can turn
to writing the “install” script:

~/kit/package/foo9000:>emacs install
#!/bin/sh
. parameters.include Import host foo9000.host
echo host=$host > ????/mgr/foo9000.cfg
cp ????/dist/foo9000/????/libfoo9000.so ????/bin

There are a few details (???? in the preceding script) we need to provide:

- Where is the instance directory in which the install is being created?

- Where is the kit we're installing from?

- Which platform is being installed?

Although we could include these questions in the “parameters” script, that may confuse users because they already entered that information earlier in the install. Instead, we import parameter variables from other packages that can provide the information we need. This is possible because each successful installation using the irisinstall, irisinstall_client or irisinstall_silent scripts (as described in InterSystems IRIS Installation) creates the parameters.isc file, which contains these v ariables and their values, in the installation directory. The variables in the parameters.isc file are listed in the InterSystems IRIS Installation Parameter File Variables table at the end of this appendix.

Note:

For security reasons, the parameters.isc file is accessible only by the root user .

In order to use the parameter variables from a particular package, we must inform the package installer that our package (foo9000) depends on the other package and, therefore, our package must be processed later in each phase than the other
package. We do this by adding “prerequisite” values to our package's manifest.isc file:

~/kit/package/foo9000:>emacs manifest.isc package: foo9000 prerequisite: server_location prerequisite: legacy_dist prerequisite: platform_selection

Now we can import parameter variables from these packages and use them to complete our install script:

~/kit/package/foo9000:>emacs install
#!/bin/sh
. parameters.include Import host foo9000.host Import tgtdir "server_location.target_dir" Import srcdir "legacy_dist.source_dir" Import platform_family "platform_selection.platform_family"
echo host=$host > $tgtdir/mgr/foo9000.cfg
cp $srcdir/dist/foo9000/$platform_family/libfoo9000.so $tgtdir/bin

Our package (foo9000) is nearly complete. The final task is to add our package to the prerequisite list for an appropriate preexisting package. Then, to complete installation of that package, the package installer processes ours. In this case, we want our library to be installed and configured an y time an InterSystems IRIS server is installed, so we add our new package
to the “database_server” package's prerequisite list inside its manifest.isc file:

~/kit/package/database_server:>emacs manifest.isc package: database_server prerequisite: legacy_dist prerequisite: platform_selection prerequisite: server prerequisite: server_location prerequisite: upgrade prerequisite: available_disk_space prerequisite: posix_tools ... prerequisite: isql prerequisite: zlib prerequisite: udp prerequisite: bi prerequisite: foo9000

As you can see, many packages are required to create a server installation, but now, when we run irisinstall, our package
(foo9000) is configured and installed:

~/kit:>sudo ./irisinstall Your system type is 'SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 (x64)'.
Currently defined instances:
IRIS instance 'INSTANCE1' directory: /home/testUser/INSTANCE1 versionid: 2018.1.0.508.0 conf file: iris.cpf (SuperServer port = 1972) status: crashed, last used Sat Sep 22 08:37:32 2018 Enter instance name: INSTANCEPACK1 Do you want to create IRIS instance 'INSTANCEPACK1' ? Y ...
